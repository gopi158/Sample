My name is Adam, CEO and Founder of http://www.fame-boost.com, a website that offers a new and radical way to promote your business online. We''re contacting you because we noticed that your business isn''t taking advantage of social media to reach its full potential on the web. \r\n \r\nIf you were to look at the most successful and prominent leaders in your industry, without a doubt you''d find that they''ve taken advantage of what social media has to offer. They utilize social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. Your business can also take advantage of these platforms! You don''t have to be the little guy! \r\n \r\nBut simply signing up for one of these accounts and updating here and there isn''t enough -- unfortunately the phrase, "build it and they will come" doesn''t apply to the online world. You also must apply what we in the industry like to call "social media supplementation." \r\n \r\nSocial Media Supplementation involves supplementing your social media account with tons of high quality followers, likes, and views that will by nature of the online world promote your business and attract loads of new customers. Your business will be ranked higher in search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing, and it''s a way to give your customers the confidence that you are a respected and a established business.  Our likes, followers, and views come from real people, just like me and you, who are potential customers is the future!  And now with our Valentine''s Day sale, we would like to exclusively offer you a 40% mega discount on the supplementation of all your social media accounts! \r\n \r\nWe also offer 50 Facebook Fanpage Likes for just $1, so you have the chance to verify the integrity and quality of our likes. On top of that, we use PayPal, so you''re method of payment is completely private and safe -- only PayPal will see it. \r\n \r\nHave any questions? Want to learn more?

From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs_dev-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary.

With hundreds of parties going on today, it&#8217;s more visible than ever just how popular WordPress has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who has ever contributed to this project: your labors of love made this day possible.</strong></p>\n<p>But today isn&#8217;t just about reflecting on how we got this far (though I thought <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/">Matt&#8217;s reflection on the first ten years</a> was lovely). We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif'' alt='';)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:374:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:51:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 10th Anniversary Tees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:40:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Store";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"swag";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"wp10";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2561";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:338:"In honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary celebrations, we&#8217;ve put a special 10th anniversary tshirt in the swag store at cost &#8212; $10 per shirt plus shipping.

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality.

I happened to stumble across a recently developed plugin called <a title="https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward" href="https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward">PressForward</a>. Developed for the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at <a href="http://gmu.edu" target="_blank">George Mason University</a> by <a href="http://aramzs.me" target="_blank">Aram Zucker-Scharff</a>, <a href="http://boone.gorg.es/" target="_blank">Boone B. Gorges</a>, and <a href="http://clioweb.org" target="_blank">Jeremy Boggs</a>, PressForward provides not only a set of curation tools for authors, but a simple feedreader as well. The plugin is in beta form and it&#8217;s obvious once you start using it but here is my experience with it thus far.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7377" alt="PressForward Interface" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward1.jpg?resize=500%2C274" /></a></p>\n<p>My main interest was determining whether PressForward could work as my primary feedreader with the added benefit of being within the back-end of WordPress. After experimenting with it for the better part of the day, I&#8217;ve determined that it&#8217;s not something that fulfills my needs. For starters, there is no way to browse feeds by folder/site, it&#8217;s all or nothing. Adding feeds is another matter. It&#8217;s not as simple as clicking an RSS feed button and adding the site to the back-end of WordPress. Instead, you&#8217;ll need to link to a OPML file or provide the URL of a single feed. In the future, it would be beneficial to have the ability to upload an OPML file instead.</p>\n<h2>What And Who This Plugin Is Really Meant For:</h2>\n<p>The ideas behind this plugin start to shine when you consider its feature set mixed with a multi-author website. Say we have a website with 7 authors dedicated to all things WordPress. All 7 authors can use the feedreader in PressForward to curate content from those feeds and then nominate their content to be published to the front page. When a piece of content is nominated, it goes under review and from here, authors can automatically create a draft post from the nominated content.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward3.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7378" alt="Press forward Draft" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward3.jpg?resize=249%2C149" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the administrators that can curate content. PressForward has drop-down menus that control the permission levels for specific sections of the plugin. I could see this becoming handy for someone that wanted to create a crowd-sourcing site dedicated to a specific topic.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward4.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7379" alt="PressForward Permission Settings" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pressforward4.jpg?resize=337%2C306" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the other neat aspects is the built-in commenting system. Each article can be commented on which aids in collaborating on the story. Those comments are not accessible to the public.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>PressForward is not a good recommendation for single site authors looking to replace their desktop or service based feedreaders with something that exists within WordPress. However, this is definitely a plugin to keep your eyes on if you&#8217;re the owner of a multi-authored website that covers specific topics and would like an easier way to collaborate with others on different stories.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/mb-pcnNNH3w" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 22:17:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"WPTavern: WordPress 3.6 Status Update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7373";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/3Aw2itwe0Y8/wordpress-3-6-status-update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1533:"<p>I&#8217;ve received some emails and Twitter responses asking me if I knew any information as to when WordPress 3.6 would be released. After looking around, it was clear that not a lot of information about the upcoming release is available. I stopped by the WordPress developers chat today to figure out what was going on and here is what I know. There is still quite a bit of work to be done before 3.6 is officially released. When I posed the question of when could we expect either a new beta or 3.6 to be released, here was the answer I received from Andrew Nacin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When it&#8217;s done.

At the same time, I&#8217;ve been reminded that if there are no updates on the Make.Core.WordPress site it&#8217;s because the developers are knee deep in code trying to get things fixed.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3Aw2itwe0Y8" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 21:09:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WordPress.tv: Billie Hillier: How to Make Readers &amp;

While his personal project won&#8217;t be a direct WP.com competitor, he&#8217;ll use the freemimum model popularized by Automattic. The service will have one theme, not many although he mentions the possibility of child themes down the road.

That is hard to believe considering it&#8217;s never been as easy to publish content online as it is today. However, whether or not WordPress is the best tool for <strong>THAT</strong> job is up for debate. There is a reason why some WordPress faithful like Jason Schuller of <a href="http://press75.com/" title="http://press75.com/">Press75.com</a> have stopped using WordPress for their personal sites and instead, have gone off to create <a href="http://dropplets.com/" title="http://dropplets.com/">their own vision</a> of what a publishing platform should be like. I asked Jason what pushed him over the edge to stop using WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not sure that any one thing in particular pushed me over the edge. Being excited, happy and passionate about what I’m working on/with is very important to me, and I no longer feel any of those things when it comes to WordPress. Creating a simple WordPress theme (for example) has become a grueling task because there are certain expectations that you have to consider in order for the WordPress community to accept your work. </p>\n<p>I still think WordPress is an amazing piece of software that has opened so many doors for so many people and that is something I will never forget&#8230; it’s just not something that interests me in its current state or direction. My focus is on creating simple/elegant solutions that actual people can use without having to spend weeks reading through tutorials or sifting through admin menus. Also, in order to continue to learn and grow as an entrepreneur I have to leave WordPress behind and find my own path.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then there is <a href="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Manual#Introduction" title="http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Manual#Introduction">Habari</a>. Habari is another project created from the ground up from former WordPress developers/users. If you want to hear Matt&#8217;s thoughts on Habari at the time, I highly encourage you to <a href="http://wp-community.org/2007/01/18/episode-18-habari-wordpress-206-released-wordpress-21-enters-beta/" title="http://wp-community.org/2007/01/18/episode-18-habari-wordpress-206-released-wordpress-21-enters-beta/">listen to episode 18 of the original WordPress Podcast</a> from January 18th, 2007 starting at the 10:34 mark. Their news bit includes a quote from Matt with his thoughts on the release of Habari as well as open-source competitors. I wonder if his attitude on competitors is the same today as it was back then. </p>\n<p>There are a handful of other publishing platforms available but the core point I want to draw attention to is that they all seem to focus around one thing. <strong>Simplicity</strong>. One of the major features of WordPress in its early years was in fact, simplicity. Now it seems as though that simplicity is disappearing and is ending up in entirely new codebases. There is no need to panic but it&#8217;s a trend worth taking note of. </p>\n<p>I love the freedoms that WordPress provides but I&#8217;d hate to see people give up those freedoms to go behind a walled garden because WordPress is just too darn complex to use. A strong pillar of the WordPress ecosystem is its third-party community via plugins and themes. But this pillar can not exist as the foundation of WordPress, nor should it. The foundation should be the publishing software. If the third-party ecosystem becomes <em><strong>the only</strong></em> reason to use WordPress and I were a core developer, I&#8217;d be extremely disappointed. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/oRVBlIu0sX4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 21:28:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg Donates $1.5 Million To Bay Lights Project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7343";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/KhEalHFe6rI/matt-mullenweg-donates-1-5-million-to-bay-lights-project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:751:"<p>WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg has stepped up and donated the remaining 1.5 million dollars to the <a href="http://thebaylights.org/" title="http://thebaylights.org/">Bay Lights project</a> in San Francisco, California.

I was happy to make the first monetary donation when the project got started, and as of last week I was able to make a closing bookend donation for the remaining amount they needed, a bit above $1.5M. It was an honor to chip in along with the thousands of other supporters who have already donated to make the project a reality.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls. &#8212; Pablo Picasso</p></blockquote>\n<p>My hope is that over the next few years, and perhaps beyond that, the lights brighten people&#8217;s experience of San Francisco whether they see them every night or they&#8217;re one of the 16 million that visit the city every year. Hopefully that effect, however small, spreads to their other interactions long after the lights are off and the sun comes up. There are countless good causes around the world, some which I support regularly <a href="http://ma.tt/about/">are listed on my about page</a>, and I hope to have the opportunity to support many more in the future, but this close-to-home gift to a city that has given me so much seemed like the right thing right now.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen them yet, here are the lights in action, more on the <a href="http://thebaylights.org/celebrating-solutions/">tech fixes happening to the lights on TBL</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/02/bay-bridge-cable-walk/">photos I took climbing the bridge a few months ago</a>:</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 15:09:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WP Windows Phone 7: Version 2.2 Now Available: Gallery Support for self-hosted sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/?p=456";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/version-2-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3983:"<p><a href="http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpwindowsphone-2-0-gallery-support.png"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-412" alt="Version 2.2 of WordPress for Windows Phone: Gallery Support for Self-Hosted sites" src="http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpwindowsphone-2-0-gallery-support.png?w=300&h=560" width="300" height="560" /></a>Version 2.2 of WordPress for Windows Phone is now available in the Windows Phone Store. It introduces gallery support for self-hosted sites running WordPress 3.5 or higher. It also resolves many of the outstanding issues and quirks that you have mentioned on the forums and on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Galleries are a great way to share pictures with your friends and followers. An image gallery will display thumbnails for all images attached to a particular post or page. Readers can tap or click any image to launch the gallery full-screen, displaying huge versions of your images.</p>\n<p>You can create a gallery straight from your device by attaching two or more pictures to a post or a page. You can even customize the appearance of a gallery by tapping the &#8220;gallery settings&#8221; button and choosing the best options for your site.</p>\n<h3>Gallery Styles</h3>\n<p>You have great control over how the gallery will be displayed: as a thumbnail grid, or as a slideshow. Both gallery types offer a lot of options to choose, not limited to: random order, page or file attachment.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of an image gallery using the default thumbnail setting. If you click on any of the images you will be able to see what the carousel view looks like:</p>\n\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/01-dashboard/" title="01-dashboard"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/02-write-screen/" title="02 - write screen"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/03-gallery-settings/" title="03- gallery settings"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/version-2-0/04-gellery-settings/" title="04 - gellery-settings"><img /></a>\n\n<p><strong>Gallery as a slideshow</strong></p>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/version-2-2/#gallery-456-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><span>More improvements and bug fixes</span></h3>\n<p>This release also includes improvements for WordPress.com  push notifications, as well as fixes for crashes and other bugs.</p>\n<h3>Download</h3>\n<p>Ready to get the latest?

I came to the conclusion that they can&#8217;t which was the basis behind my WordPress news sites disappearing into the <a title="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-news-sites-and-the-bermuda-triangle" href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-news-sites-and-the-bermuda-triangle">bermuda triangle post</a>. I&#8217;ve had a chance to look at all the feedback surrounding the topic and it&#8217;s clear that some have totally missed the point I was trying to make. Some of the websites that have repeatedly been used as examples of success in this market include <a title="http://wpdaily.co/" href="http://wpdaily.co/">WPDaily.co</a>, <a title="http://www.wpbeginner.com/" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/">WPBeginner</a>, <a title="http://www.wpcandy.com" href="http://www.wpcandy.com">WPCandy</a>, and <a title="http://wpmu.org" href="http://wpmu.org">WPMU.org</a> to name a few. The only website in that group that comes close to what I tried to achieve is WPCandy. The other sites all have a source of income that is not based on the content they are publishing.</p>\n<p><strong>WPDaily.co</strong> &#8211; This website is backed by 8Bit</p>\n<p><strong>WPBeginner</strong> &#8211; They offer services such as consulting and custom WordPress designs.</p>\n<p><strong>WPMU.org</strong> &#8211; This site is funded by a commercial plugins and themes</p>\n<p><strong>WPRealm</strong> &#8211; All of the contributors are compensated outside of the content they produce on WPRealm. </p>\n<p>Starting to notice a trend here?</p>\n<p>All four of those websites publish WordPress news and related items on a routine basis but they&#8217;re also excellent examples of the primary point I made: <em>A news centric website takes so much time and energy to maintain and keep fresh, it’s not worth it in the long run unless you have a company backing you or an auxiliary source of cash that pays the bills and puts food on the table at the same time.</em></p>\n<p>A number of people suggested I should have started a consulting section on WPTavern but that was something I was never interested in doing. I was and still am a content creation guy. I needed to figure out how to make the content I created pay for the bills while also getting to the point where the site was self-sustainable. I tried affiliate links for themes and plugins I reviewed, display advertising, sponsorships, nothing I tried was as consistent as a 40 hour work week. I did toy with the idea of putting up a paywall but I wanted as many people as possible to read what I had to say.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe that there is space to make money providing WordPress news and information without selling out. I also think that this notion that there would be a void had Matt Mullenweg not bailed out the Tavern and funded Jeff to write there is totally false.</p>\n<p>The WordPress ecosystem is a market like any other, and holes in markets tend to be filled. What fills a hole in a particular market may take different shape over time as the solutions evolve, but people are always out there to fill voids. Especially if you can do something to fill a void that you are passionate about. <a href="http://poststat.us/on-wordpress-news-sites/" title="http://poststat.us/on-wordpress-news-sites/">Brian Krogsgard &#8211; PostStat.us On WordPress News Sites</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree with Brian that there would not have been a void had the Tavern disappeared. Once things started to go south on this website, WPCandy was rocking and rolling. I watched from the sideline as WPCandy became the coolest place to be in the WordPress community and saw Ryan Imel take ideas I had for the Tavern and turn them into reality e.g. the first print edition WordPress magazine, <a href="http://wpcandy.com/quarterly/" title="http://wpcandy.com/quarterly/">The WPCandy Quarterly</a>. Once things started to go south for WPCandy, WPDaily.co became the new popular watering hole. There is never a void in the WordPress news space. </p>\n<p>One of the few people to understand my original point is Curtis McHale. He has an <a href="https://plus.google.com/113827756965068019660/posts/EfgkNUNacea" title="https://plus.google.com/113827756965068019660/posts/EfgkNUNacea">ongoing conversation</a> taking place on Google+. At the end of his comment, he asks the following question: <em>Can a WordPress site monetize just on the news it produces? It may be a naïve assumption that it&#8217;s possible (without a ton of ads).﻿</em> A similar <a href="http://wpmu.org/wordpress-news-sites-are-they-worth-paying-for/" title="http://wpmu.org/wordpress-news-sites-are-they-worth-paying-for/">type question asked on WMPU.org</a> <em>Is WordPress news worth paying for?</em> After my experience with WPTavern, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible for a WordPress news centric site to survive solely on the content it produces. I&#8217;m interested to see if Brian proves me wrong with PostStat.us.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll close out this post by providing these words of wisdom. </p>\n<blockquote><p>My advice to anyone wanting to start a WordPress news centric website, especially if you think it’s going to make you some money is to stop immediately. Focus your efforts on where the real cash is. Commercial plugins, themes, and services. A news centric website takes so much time and energy to maintain and keep fresh, it’s not worth it in the long run unless you have a company backing you or an auxiliary source of cash that pays the bills and puts food on the table at the same time. The value and worth comes from writing code, not text.</p></blockquote>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/ROLwPSYuSzE" height="1" width="1"

src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeLogo.jpg?resize=91%2C57" /></a>Custom post types are one of those things in WordPress that&#8217;s been difficult for me to figure out. However, after reviewing the <a title="http://demo.audiotheme.com/americanaura/" href="http://demo.audiotheme.com/americanaura/">Americanaura theme</a> combined with the <a title="https://audiotheme.com/view/audiotheme/" href="https://audiotheme.com/view/audiotheme/">AudioTheme framework</a>, I have a better understanding of why custom post types are so cool.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeTips.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7322" alt="AudioTheme Tips" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeTips.jpg?resize=500%2C285" /></a></p>\n<p>Unlike a traditional theme framework, the majority of the functionality is located in the AudioTheme Plugin. Without this plugin, AudioTheme themes will not function. This setup enables the separation between code and design. The nuts and bolts behind this theme are the custom post types. There are three primary post types, <strong>Gigs, Discography, and Videos</strong>. Each one has a set of custom meta boxes like record details, or ticket prices. While the screenshot shows off a tool-tip, I would like to see more of these added. For example, when adding a new gig, there is a custom meta box for Tickets. One of the fields is for configuring a tickets URL. It&#8217;s not obvious if this URL is something within the theme or a URL to an outside source such as TicketMaster. A simple tool-tip could explain exactly what that field is for. However, most of the theme is self-explanatory.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeVolumeControl.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7324" alt="AudioTheme Volume Slider" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeVolumeControl.jpg?resize=303%2C159" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the coolest features within this framework is the jukebox. The source of music can come from a record or a list of tracks. Once the jukebox is set up, a media player will show up at the bottom of the browser window giving visitors the option to browse through tracks, stop/play, click to a specific point in the music timeline, and volume control. While it&#8217;s a small nitpick, I found the volume control confusing. In most media players, moving the slider<em> down to up</em> or<em> left to right</em> will increase volume. In the jukebox, moving from left to right will increase the volume but the way it&#8217;s displayed makes it look as though the volume is being lowered. A simple color switch would solve this problem.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeJukebox.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7323" alt="AudioTheme" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AudioThemeJukebox.jpg?resize=560%2C192" /></a></p>\n<p>Both the themes and the plugin framework are licensed under the GPLv2, the same license as WordPress. While checking out, you&#8217;ll notice text that stipulates how many sites you can use the framework on. This is related to how many sites can receive support and is not a restriction of use. Because of the separation between theme and plugin, each has its own price tag. If you&#8217;re a theme developer, you&#8217;ll probably want to look at purchasing only the AudioTheme framework and design around it. But for non-coders, you&#8217;ll most likely need to buy both a theme <strong>and</strong> the framework. However, the website states that any theme purchase will come with a personal license to use the framework.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the most user-friendly setup but I like the versatility it provides them as a company. By keeping the framework separate, AudioThemes can work with other  companies to build designs around their plugin as they did with <a title="https://audiotheme.com/view/blocco/" href="https://audiotheme.com/view/blocco/">Press75</a>. I&#8217;m hoping that in the future, they have a ton of designs to choose from.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Overall, the theme I reviewed along with the framework was not only easy to install, but easy to use as well. I remember 5-8 years ago that some of the features that come standard with the AudioTheme Framework and with WordPress were very hard to come by in any other CMS. Take the Jukebox for example. Something like the Jukebox 5-8 years ago would involve installing hacks or using some sort of third-party service. This example of utilizing custom post types has taught me why their versatility is such an exciting component of WordPress. Based on this theme and some other examples I&#8217;ve seen, when a good design is paired with custom post types, magical things happen. I can&#8217;t wait to come across indie or established artists utilizing AudioTheme to get their music to the world, without the need for a middle man.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/1aN6wZQjnf4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:04:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: What’s Going On With The WordPress Importer?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7313";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/c2TvkfWm2CQ/whats-going-on-with-the-wordpress-importer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3608:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPImporterRatings.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPImporterRatings.jpg?resize=164%2C181" alt="WordPress Importer Ratings" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7317" /></a>A few days ago, I received an email informing me that the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/">WordPress importer</a> plugin was having issues and was at the brink of receiving as many 1 star ratings as it had 5. It&#8217;s never a good sign when you see support forum stats like this: <em>0 of 10 support threads in the last two months have been resolved</em>. But considering the topic creator has to mark the topic as resolved, this is not a fool-proof method of determining if a plugin is broken. From what I can tell, most of the issues surround partial imports and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-import-images-file-attachements" title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-import-images-file-attachements">importing of images</a>. </p>\n<p>I used the importer to move all the content from WPTavern.com to a local install of WordPress. I chose to do a full export/import. The WXR file was around 17 megs but WordPress seemed to take forever to process the file, even on my local machine. While all the images were imported properly, they were not attached to the proper posts. The images that were displayed on the local site were linked to the ones within the media library on WPTavern.com. After dropping all the tables from the database and starting over, I tried to import my files again with the same results. Just to see what would happen, I exported only my posts with attachments to see if both would be imported correctly. While the posts were imported correctly, none of the media attachments were brought over into the media library. As illustrated in the support forum post I linked above, the only way to move media attachments from one site to another is to export/import <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>. If I select attachments to be downloaded and exported, then that&#8217;s what should happen no matter which variety of ways I export the content. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/NoMediaAttachments.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/NoMediaAttachments.jpg?resize=328%2C240" alt="No Media Attachments" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7315" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve exported/imported content from one WordPress site to another so I don&#8217;t remember how the process is suppose to play out but if the behavior I described above is considered normal, the import process is definitely not as painless as it should be. After all, exporting/importing from WordPress to WordPress should be as easy as counting 1,2,3. Unlike other plugins that have a specific author, this one is developed by the <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wordpressdotorg/" title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wordpressdotorg/">WordPressdotorg</a> team so it&#8217;s not clear who to contact. </p>\n<p>If you have used the WordPress export/import plugin within the past few weeks and have also run into problems, I&#8217;d love for you to chime in on the comments. I&#8217;d especially like to hear from those that export/import sites on a routine basis. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/c2TvkfWm2CQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 23:51:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.8-beta1 is now available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=165934";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://buddypress.org/2013/06/buddypress-1-8-beta1-is-now-available/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37727:"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, start your testing engines: BuddyPress 1.8-beta1 is ready for a lap around the track.</p>\n<p>If you develop BuddyPress themes or plugins, or if you run a BP-powered community site, now is the time to start testing the next major version of BuddyPress in your development environments. BP 1.8 will feature a large number of fixes and enhancements. For the full list, see <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=1.8">the 1.8 milestone in Trac</a>. Here is a short list of major changes, areas where you may want to focus your testing energies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>BP_Group_Extension</code></strong> has been largely rewritten, with the goal of making Group Extension plugins faster and more consistent to write (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4955">#4955</a>). We&#8217;ve worked hard to make sure that existing <code>BP_Group_Extension</code> plugins will continue to work as before, but we encourage you to verify your own plugins. In the upcoming days, I&#8217;ll be writing updated Codex documentation for the Group Extension API, so you can see how the new features in BP 1.8 will make writing group extension plugins radically simpler. Watch <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com">bpdevel.wordpress.com</a> for updates.</li>\n<li>The <strong>group administration panels</strong> in the Dashboard have seen some improvements &#8211; in particular, to the way that the Manage Members section works (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4482">#4482</a>, <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4977">#4977</a>). Pagination support has been added to the member lists in these panels, as well as the <code>bp_group_has_members()</code> stack that underpins the panels.</li>\n<li>The <strong>bp-legacy stylesheet</strong> has undergone a process of &#8220;detheming&#8221; (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4953">#4953</a>). We&#8217;ve combed through the bp-legacy CSS &#8211; which provides BP-specific styling on themes that don&#8217;t have native support for BP &#8211; and removed some of the lingering stylistic remnants of the bp-default theme. Now, things like font faces, buttons, and form element styling will be inherited from your WordPress theme in a much more graceful way.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve introduced a new <strong>template hierarchy layer for top-level templates</strong> (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4639">#4639</a>). Similar to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy">WordPress&#8217;s template hierarchy</a>, this new feature allows themes to provide top-level template files that are specific to a component or item. For example, if your theme contains a template at <code>groups/index-directory.php</code>, it&#8217;ll be used instead of <code>buddypress.php</code> or <code>page.php</code> when viewing the Groups directory. See <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7212">r7212</a> for more details on the hierarchy, and watch the <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org">Codex</a> and <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com">bpdevel</a> for documentation between now and the 1.8 release.</li>\n<li><code>bp_has_groups()</code> and <code>bp_has_activities()</code> now accept a <strong><code>meta_query</code> parameter</strong> (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3521">#3521</a>). This means you can filter a group or activity query based on groupmeta or activitymeta, using the very same <code>meta_query</code> syntax familiar from <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Custom_Field_Parameters">WP_Query</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>@-mentions can now be disabled</strong> (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3388">#3388</a>), by adding <code>add_filter( ''bp_activity_do_mentions'', ''__return_false'' );</code> to your bp-custom.php file.</li>\n<li><strong>RSS feeds for activity streams</strong> have been overhauled (<a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5020">#5020</a>). Our RSS implementation has been brought more in line with best practices for feed construction. And feed-building logic has been abstracted from myriad standalone feed templates into a single <code>BP_Activity_Feed</code> class, which makes the creation of custom feeds a breeze.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that BuddyPress 1.8-beta1 is beta software, and we don&#8217;t recommend running it on a production site quite yet.</p>\n<p>Get 1.8-beta1 via svn, or by downloading <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.1.8-beta1.zip">the zip file from wordpress.org</a>.

to best provide support for the software you create is an interesting point of deliberation. I&#8217;ve gone through various stages and iterations, all different as circumstances have evolved, but all driven by the same question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  How can I create the best experience for the user in a way that is sustainable?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>On a podcast a while back I said something to this effect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Free support is only sustainable on either end of the spectrum. Either you have so many users that you&#8217;re able to well monetize them to the point that you have a dedicated support team tasked with making sure they are well cared for; or you have so few users that the drain on your time is negligible and can easily be handled along with other day-to-day tasks. The tricky stuff lies in the middle.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I first started writing hacks for b2 and plugins and themes for WordPress, my life looked a lot different than it does now. I had a day job which paid all my bills, a wife that also worked long hours, and the work I did on my own site was what generated most of the code I released to the community.</p>\n<p>The community was also much smaller and had a different profile back then. A handful of hackers that would use each other&#8217;s code, send each other suggestions, and generally collaborate as peers.</p>\n<p>Nowdays the profile of the average WordPress user is far different. WordPress has become a tool for business users that do not need to have technical experience to make WordPress work for them. This is awesome, but it fundamentally changes the nature of the support requests I see.</p>\n<p>My station in life has changed quite a bit too. I have a daughter, I run a great team of 15 people and I&#8217;m dealing with some <a href="https://alexking.org/blog/2013/05/31/cancer">medical issues</a>. I don&#8217;t have the time that I used to, and what time I do have I&#8217;d rather spend building something than responding to emails.</p>\n<p>How I<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> handle support today is to break it down into two types of support:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>User Support</li>\n<li>Product Support</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With <strong>User Support</strong>, we provide one-on-one attention and do our best to solve whatever issues the user might be experiencing. This can even extend to troubleshooting plugin conflicts and server configuration issues. We reserve this level of support for our paid products (<a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/">RAMP</a>, <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington-build/">Carrington Build</a>, etc.).</p>\n<p>For our free products, we provide <strong>Product Support</strong>. This means we listen and pay attention to bug reports and try to fix anything that appears to have a reproducible use case. However we do not provide one-on-one support for users and do not dive deeply into one-off reports of edge cases.</p>\n<p>I feel that this is a reasonable compromise, and I believe that most of the users of my products agree. There will always be people who believe they can make unreasonable demands on your time, but luckily there&#8217;s a handy button on those emails (or even voicemails, yikes!) for resolving them with minimal effort.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A few years back I had the idea that the collective support burden on WordPress plugin developers had grown to the point that we should all outsource it to a 3rd party. To support this, I created WP HelpCenter and tried to partner with plugin and theme developers through a referral program.</p>\n<p>This ended up being a flop, for a few reasons. The main on was users that actually needed support were typically unwilling to pay for it. From their perspective the plugin/theme wasn&#8217;t working and they were doing the developer a favor by reporting a bug. They certainly weren&#8217;t going to pay anything for it. What users are willing to pay for is customization, and that&#8217;s an entirely different beast.</p>\n<p>I still think something like WP HelpCenter could work, but it would be a lot of work and would need real buy-in from all parts of the community.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\n<a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> uses the same approach.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 19:46:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WPTavern: I’ll Be On DradCast Tonight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7306";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/lbXLV2LPKVU/ill-be-on-dradcast-tonight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:920:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dradcastlogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dradcastlogo.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Dradcast Logo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-7307" /></a> I have the pleasure of being the guest host for <a href="http://dradcast.com/" title="http://dradcast.com/">episode 16 of DradCast</a> tonight at 8PM Eastern time.

src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemeslogo.jpg?resize=128%2C106" /></a>I&#8217;ve made it a habit to read WordPress related Press Releases despite how boring most of them are. Occasionally, I&#8217;ll come across something that is pretty interesting such as <a title="http://teslathemes.com/" href="http://teslathemes.com/">TeslaThemes</a>. TeslaThemes is a brand new theme club with the goal of producing one theme per month. In particular, I thought their <a title="http://teslathemes.com/wp-themes/coolstuff/" href="http://teslathemes.com/wp-themes/coolstuff/">Cool Stuff theme</a> introduced a unique way of displaying content via Post Formats and a timeline. After browsing around the site, I decided to get in touch with TeslaThemes to find out how they plan on surviving the WordPress theme market, especially as a theme club. <span id="more-7292"></span></p>\n<p><strong>In an ever growing crowd of companies, what do you think will set TeslaThemes apart from the competition?</strong></p>\n<p>We are aware of this very fast growing market, and especially this makes us very confident in what we do and how we do. At this moment income is not a priority, we’re mainly focused on delivering really useful themes to end-users, we do not want to create this “<em>plastic</em>”, “<em>industrial</em>”, “<em>copy paste</em>” WordPress templates as so many do. The market is over saturated with themes and templates and they all look the same. People need something unique, that can stand out of the crowd. We have a very loyal group of followers that give us the boost and confidence for what we have planned.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7294" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesPricing.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesPricing.jpg?resize=500%2C187" alt="Tesla Themes Pricing" class="size-large wp-image-7294" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These prices will be changing soon</p></div>\n<p><strong>In your opinion, what makes a good WordPress theme?</strong></p>\n<p>Depends on who is asked. For many, they say 90% is design and 10% code, for others vice versa. We want to merge it to a golden middle, creating handcrafted design interface plus very intuitive customization process for the user, so that he enjoys personalizing his own website, without headache or paying additional developers for that. At the end of the day, when everything is done, what the rest see the design, its usability and navigation, how clean and understandable is it. For sure everyone appreciates it. No one has time to search on the page, our eyes must catch everything from a single glance. To resume, important is the design, the concept, perfect code and very intelligent and user friendly framework that will guide anyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Why have you chosen to develop commercial themes for WordPress instead of Joomla, or Drupal?</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, we do not stop on WordPress, at this very minute we have 5 templates in the queue, where 1 is ecommerce. However, the main course is WordPress indeed. Our research shows that more and more people are opting for a simple yet complex blog or website based on WordPress, this is already both a trend and necessity. If at the beginning WordPress was meant for blogs, now it&#8217;s escalated to pretty big web applications that are using it. At TeslaThemes we can adapt any theme to any needs.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesWordPress.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesWordPress.jpg?resize=389%2C146" alt="Tesla Themes WordPress" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7295" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What is the Tesla Framework?</strong></p>\n<p>Tesla Framework is another one of our proud products. The decision to develop it was unanimous and instant. There are many reason why, first of all we were thinking about our customers who are purchasing our Premium Templates. We’ve noticed that not very many have any technical background, the tickets we were receiving at the time were related rather to lack of technical experience and WordPress knowledge than some technical problems of the theme. At a certain point we had a huge data base of Q&#038;A and decided to build our own Framework, adapting and combining all the issues we’ve got during our daily activity. The end result, without modesty is a brilliant tool that helps anyone to customize its template in a very simple and fun way. We noticed an 85% drop for tickets, since we launched it and all the feedback we get from our customers is just great. Another strong reason to make it was the technical aspect, it increased our theme development up to 40%. Now any Tesla developer can work on any of our themes without any problem, switching whenever is needed, it is a unique platform that saves time and development costs. At the end of the day Tesla Framework was a very inspired decision both for end-users and our developers.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesFramework.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesFramework.jpg?resize=500%2C201" alt="TeslaThemes Framework" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7296" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Theme clubs are a tough way to do business. Many have come and gone. Why have you decided to go with the club route instead of charging $60-$70 per theme?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s correct, Jeff. For sure we will not go for too long with club way. The reason we have so affordable prices for single themes and annual subscription, is lack of financial priority at the moment. Of course we are not Red Cross, we also have bills and want to drive nice cars and nice vacations. All the prices for sure will go up in the next few months. Our design and development department are working now on 5 templates that must come up by middle of July, 2013. The 24/7 support we have, the handcrafted design, uniqueness, they all cost money and I am sure, people want to have really the best and they will buy our themes. </p>\n<p><strong>One of my favorite designs from TeslaThemes is the Cool Stuff theme. What was the inspiration behind the timeline display of content?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s right, Cool Stuff is one of our best sellers. It is very simple and has a modern layout. The idea behind it was very simple, inspired by flat design trend we decided to create our first flat design theme. It was rather from fun, but turned out to be a success. As a matter of fact, 4 out of 5 themes we have in the queue, are flat. The timeline display gives a faster navigation thru the page, saves user’s time and keeps a higher focus on the content. And content is king!</p>\n<div id="attachment_7297" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesTimeline.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TeslaThemesTimeline.jpg?resize=500%2C297" alt="Tesla Themes Timeline" class="size-large wp-image-7297" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cool way of displaying content via post formats and a timeline</p></div>\n<p><strong>Do you have any opinions on themes bundling plugins whether they are commercial or free?</strong></p>\n<p>I think that bundling plugins (whether they are commercial or free) is not good for the end user. By nature, plugins need to be detached from the framework, because in case something goes wrong the plugin can be deactivated and the user can maintain a working website without losing traffic. On the other side, bundling plugins with a theme means to compel a user to use only one plugin for a given enhancement, when the user could have used another plugin, giving the same functionality, but which the user knows better how to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to license the themes under the same license WordPress has? (GPL V2)</strong></p>\n<p>Because adopting this kind of license for our themes is better than writing our own, and limit what our users can do with their themes. GPL gives a sense of freedom, and clients love to hear that they have the freedom to do whatever they want with their themes after they buy it. In addition, having this license gives us some advantages, like the opportunity to promote our marketplace on WordPress.org </p>\n<p><strong>Anything you would like to say to the WordPress Community?</strong></p>\n<p>To keep up and continue to innovate. Inspiration and satisfaction. The tough market is a risk indeed but let’s see it rather as an opportunity to stand out of the crowd with great service and products. The competition develops and brings real value for everyone.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/Z4Euz_XasNc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 22:19:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: Experimental Plugin Review – Inline Preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7284";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/IqjqafuFxhs/experimental-plugin-review-inline-preview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2162:"<p><a title="http://www.chrisfinke.com/2013/06/11/inline-preview-plugin-for-wordpress/" href="http://www.chrisfinke.com/2013/06/11/inline-preview-plugin-for-wordpress/">Inline Preview</a> is a brand new plugin being developed by Christopher Finke. Instead of previewing posts in a new browser tab, this plugin adds an editor to the right of the post within the same tab enabling you to see what the post will look like.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/InlinePreview1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="size-full wp-image-7288" alt="Inline Preview" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/InlinePreview1.jpg?resize=500%2C375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Editor And Post In The Same Tab</p></div>\n<p>If you end up giving this plugin a try, be warned that once you click the preview button, the only way to close the inline preview area is to either reload the page or save the draft. Once I saw a screenshot of this plugin in action, I was initially excited because this is one of the features I saw in Ghost that intrigued me. However, this plugin is only at the experimental level and I&#8217;m not sure how far Chris is going to take it. But if he plans on putting more development time into it, here are a couple things on my checklist I&#8217;d like to see.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have the inline preview only show the content area of the website, no sidebar, no footer, none of the unnecessary details. Since my content area is only 600 pixels wide, it would make better use of my screen real estate.</li>\n<li>Real-time editing so that as I type or add images, I can see how those changes would look on the site.</li>\n<li>The ability to change the width of the post editor and the inline preview so that I can apply a size that works best for my monitor.</li>\n<li>An easy way to close the inline editor without having to reload the entire page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anything else you can think of that would make a plugin like this useful to you?</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/IqjqafuFxhs" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 20:31:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WP Android: You’ve Got Notifications!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://android.wordpress.org/?p=847";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://android.wordpress.org/2013/06/11/notifications/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3864:"<p><a href="http://android.wordpress.org"><img src="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/wordpress-for-android-2-4-wordpress-com-notifications.jpg?w=242&h=491" alt="Version 2.4 of WordPress for Android: Notifications panel on a Samsung Galaxy S3" width="242" height="491" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-861" /></a>Need to get your WordPress.com or Jetpack notifications on the go?

During that year I had tried just about every blogging script out there. The one I chose to use for my travel blog was Serendipity. I had been using CMS&#8217;s for several years so I started looking more into using blogging platforms to create small content websites. Eventually, that led me to WordPress and I have used it ever since. <span id="more-7269"></span></p>\n<p><strong>I discovered you through BloggingTips.com.

When I sold <a title="http://www.bloggingtips.com/" href="http://www.bloggingtips.com/">BloggingTips</a> at the beginning of 2010, I had been working on it every day for 3 years. I was keen to do something else. My next blog, <a title="http://www.wphub.com" href="http://www.wphub.com">WP Mods</a>, was sold in part because of an upcoming trip throughout South America and partly to free up more time to work on other websites I was developing.</p>\n<p>To date I have over $200k worth of sales on Flippa, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself a website flipper. All of the websites I have sold have been developed from scratch by me.</p>\n<p><strong>I understand you make a substantial amount of your income from your work online. From your experience, which revenue generating technique has garnered the most cash?</strong></p>\n<p>I make 100% of my income online. I started working online in 2000. I was working in Finance at the time and would work on websites at night. I probably made a few hundred dollars a month, which was never enough to leave my full time job. I did make a few good sales from domains. One time in 2002 I bought a domain name at work at 8.30am and sold it at 12.00pm for around $300-$400. I had bigger sales but that was probably the most satisfying due to how quickly I turned a profit.</p>\n<p>Around 2004 I started making enough to work full time online. All of my money was coming from affiliate commissions. At the height of the gambling craze I was making over $20,000 a month. That helped pay off some debts from university and allowed some fun trips around the world.</p>\n<p>Today, I still make most of my money from affiliate referrals, adsense and banner ad sales. I am starting to make money from selling books and I earn money from freelance writing too.</p>\n<p><strong>Back in May of 2009, you and Sarah started a WordPress theme club titled appropriately enough, <a title="http://www.blogthemesclub.com/" href="http://www.blogthemesclub.com/">BlogThemesClub.com</a>. Whatever happened to the club and what valuable lessons did you learn from that experience?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BlogThemesClubLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7272" alt="blogthemesclub" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/BlogThemesClubLogo.jpg?resize=444%2C111" /></a></p>\n<p>haha We sold that one too :)</p>\n<p>That site developed out of BloggingTips.com. Through that site I had released several WordPress themes to the community free. We then looked into releasing premium designs to blog readers but later decided that it would be better long term to sell themes from a new domain.</p>\n<p>I am primarily a writer/marketer and Sarah is primarily a coder. Due to this, we had to outsource all the design work. This was not without its difficulties. Looking back, we probably should have brought in a designer as a partner from the start. That would have allowed us to develop themes quicker. I am sure we could have made it a success if we stuck to it though we decided to cut our losses and move on as we were spending a lot of time on it.</p>\n<p>It was a good experience and I did learn a lot from running a membership driven website and with working with a partner, so it is not something look back on with regret.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find it difficult to generate content for your various sites or does it come natural?</strong></p>\n<p>No. That is something that I have never had a problem with. Never have, never will. I am always reading other blogs and I buy books regularly too, so I am never short of ideas. My personal blog <a title="http://www.kevinmuldoon.com" href="http://www.kevinmuldoon.com">KevinMuldoon.com</a> currently has 125 draft posts, all of which are partly written or have details of what needs to be written.</p>\n<p>The main problem is time to actually write. Over the next few months I need to greatly reduce my own writing responsibilities and bring in others to help me maintain my websites and blogs.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously you&#8217;re only one person. What tips can you provide for those looking to hire people to write for their site?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPModsLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7273" alt="WPMods Logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPModsLogo.jpg?resize=258%2C69" /></a></p>\n<p>Unless you want your website or blog to always remain at the same level, you need to bring people in to help you. With BloggingTips.com I had over a dozen people writing regularly. By the time I sold WPMods.com I had two or three people helping me write articles.</p>\n<p>Obviously, getting the right people is key. It can be tempting to just get the cheapest writers but you need to remember that sometimes a badly written post is worse than having no post published at all. At the start it can be a balancing act trying to keep writing costs down and turn a profit, but long term it is worth it. Generally speaking, I would rather spend money on hiring good writers than spending money on an advertising campaign or some SEO service.</p>\n<p>As you rightly point out, there is only one of me, so for me to move on and do other things, I need to hire other people. There is no other way round it. The old idiom &#8220;<strong>hire people smarter than you</strong>&#8221; definitely runs true, and once they know what you are looking for, you should feel comfortable letting them get on with their job. Spending too much time micro-managing them can be counter-productive.</p>\n<p><strong>What is it about WordPress that has you using it for just about every site you create?</strong></p>\n<p>Possibility.</p>\n<p>No other platform out there, blogging or otherwise, comes even close to offering the same level of customization that WordPress does. Can you think of any other platform that offers thousands and thousands of free and premium plugins and themes?</p>\n<p><strong>What is your biggest pet peeve with WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say it is that every plugin developer out there wants to hijack my admin area and place a large menu link on my admin sidebar. There are plugins that only take two minutes to set up and then you never need to configure them again, yet they hog my sidebar. All major plugin developers, including Automattic, seem to be doing this.</p>\n<p>I am aware that there are plugins out there that let me remove links from the main menu and put them somewhere else, however I do not feel that WordPress users should need to do this. Why should we have to go to the hassle of cleaning up their mess?</p>\n<p><strong>Where would you like to see WordPress 5 years from now?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wordpresslogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wordpresslogo.png?resize=150%2C150" alt="wordpresslogo" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-422" /></a></p>\n<p>I like the fact that WordPress has started removing things like blogrolls and adding them back as plugins. The core version should not be too bloated.</p>\n<p>The problem is that there is so much functionality lacking from the core that you end up installing lots of plugins, thereby slowing down your site. Take commenting for example, WordPress blogs suffer from spam so badly that you need to install Akismet right off the bat. Then you need to install at least one additional plugin to reduce spam, whether it be to add a CAPTCHA field or trick bots into thinking they have completed all fields.</p>\n<p>Many people have turned to third-party commenting systems to address this, though they are not always ideal either. So, like many people, I have started using Jetpack for my comments. It works great, but using that plugin means that I a need to install many other things that I do not want installed.</p>\n<p>The same thing can be said about security. I have had a few of my blogs infected with malware over the last year so I now install security plugins on every WordPress website I own. It would be better if WordPress tackled this problem head on and make the product more secure. I understand that WordPress is always going to be targeted more than other platforms due to its popularity, though when it comes to the point of needing to install anti-spam and anti-malware plugins every time they use WordPress, you need to step back and think about whether the core product needs to be upgraded.</p>\n<p>Today, I have over a dozen plugins that I install on every website. I review the plugins I have installed regularly, though a quick check on my personal blog shows that I have 37 activated plugins. Many of these plugins address problems with other plugins or problems with the core. For example, I have&nbsp;Manual Control for Jetpack to stop the Jetpack plugin automatically enabling new modules they add and I have&nbsp;WP Missed Schedule installed to stop WordPress not publishing my articles on time (and never sending me an email to notify me of this).</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I think that WordPress is starting to look dated in some respects. Without doubt it is functional, but along the way it has lost its style. I use the WordPress iOS app regularly and it works great, however accessing WordPress through my browser seems clunky at times.</p>\n<p>WordPress has become the number one content management system in the world, though I think there is a danger of it losing its title as the best blogging platform. New blog platforms such as SquareSpace and Ghost are simplifying the whole process of blogging and allowing people to focus more on content instead of worrying about spam, viruses and configuring cache plugins.</p>\n<p>Competition is good and I hope that WordPress can take the best features of these new platforms and integrate it into their own platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Anything you&#8217;d like to say to the entire WordPress community?</strong></p>\n<p>I would encourage people to support plugin and theme developers where they can; whether it be telling others of their good work, making a donation or upgrading to their premium products. That being said, I also think WordPress users are allowed to be critical, even of those who release products for free. As a content producer, I understand why many developers get touchy about criticism, though it is essential to their products, and WordPress as a whole, getting better.</p>\n<p>So be supportive and be critical about something if you need to be, though make sure you are polite and professional when you do so. Those who complain for the sake of complaining deserve to be ignored :)</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/BHMHzDo53Fg" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 16:48:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WPTavern: Recap Of WordCamp Milwaukee 2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7264";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/JbJHpoCeOY4/recap-of-wordcamp-milwaukee-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:850:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WordCampMilwaukee2013Logo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WordCampMilwaukee2013Logo.jpg?resize=216%2C108" alt="WordCamp Milwaukee 2013 Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7265" /></a>This past weekend, WordCamp Milwaukee 2013 took place.

You haven’t purchased the plugin from WooThemes, so they can’t support you.

This makes it virtually impossible to support the code.</li>\n<li>The WooThemes support crew will probably tell you to ask the theme author.</li>\n<li>The theme author has no real ways of supporting the plugins they bundle with the theme, simply because they didn’t write the plugin.</li>\n<li>The initial response of the theme author is often to contact the author of the plugin. Resume these steps at #1, infinite loop!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>GPL</strong> &#8211; People are still confused when they see a theme or plugin licensed under the <a title="http://wordpress.org/about/gpl/" href="http://wordpress.org/about/gpl/">GPL</a> and then see licenses that specify the number of websites the plugin can be used on. Being licensed under the GPLv2 means the code is freely available and can be modified or redistributed. During the checkout process, if the word <em>restrict</em> is in the description it generates <em>red flags</em>. It&#8217;s important to note that most commercial GPL theme/plugin licenses deal strictly with how many sites will be supported by them based on which support license you buy. In some instances such as GravityForms, you&#8217;re not only purchasing a support license, but also an API access key that provides access to updates and other functionality. The API aspects of GravityForms have nothing to do with GPL. As <a title="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9401" href="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9401">Carl Hancock points out</a>, look at Akismet, VaultPress, or WordPress.com as good examples of plugins that are GPL but the features they offer are through an API/service which is not accessible because it&#8217;s a software as a service model.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that redistributing any themes or plugins licensed under the GPL commercial or not for free or for a price is completely within the confines of the license as long as proper attribution is maintained and the copyright notice is left in tact. What the two themes on ThemeForest were doing was not illegal.</p>\n<p><strong>Abuse Of The Unlimited Sites License</strong> &#8211; This is an interesting one. Using GravityForms as an example, if you buy the unlimited sites option, you&#8217;ll have support for unlimited sites, support multi-site, have unlimited forms, unlimited entries, 1 year of updates, etc. <a title="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9296" href="http://coenjacobs.me/en/dont-buy-bundled-premium-plugins/#comment-9296">According to Simone</a>, team leader of Your Inspiration Themes, they had purchased a Developer License granting them the ability to install GravityForms on an unlimited amount of sites. They were bundling GravityForms with their themes but in order for customers to receive upgrades, they would push out a new theme update which included the newest version of GravityForms.</p>\n<p>I have to give Simone credit for coming up with a somewhat creative way of being able to offer GForms updates without their theme customers needing to have an individual access key. However, because of how GravityForms works, they have the ability to turn off keys if they discover they  are used in such a way that <a title="http://www.gravityforms.com/terms-and-conditions/" href="http://www.gravityforms.com/terms-and-conditions/">violates their TOS</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Not Getting What You Paid For</strong> &#8211; According to Simone, by bundling plugins like GForms in their themes, they are offering value. In reality, the are offering headaches. The following paragraph in Simone&#8217;s response is important to take note of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Keep in mind that we are not re-selling the plugins and above all we don’t provide key licenses to our customers. When an update of those plugins is released, we will as soon as possible release a new theme update with the new version of the plugin. We know how important is to keep updated the WordPress installation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When customers buy their themes, they&#8217;re not actually buying the plugins that are bundled with them. If that&#8217;s the case, why bother bundling the plugins at all? The only conclusion I can come to is that they are ripping off GravityForms and others while providing so called value to their customers.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>I hope YIT and ThemeForest have both learned their lesson in this ordeal. ThemeForest needs to tighten up its theme reviewing process. YIT needs to remove the commercial plugins until they can strike a unique reseller deal with both GForms and WooThemes. Since Simone claims their themes sold well without having any plugins, I hope they remove them because the overall practice of bundling plugins with themes is stupid.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/0ZyY80tRsrU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 16:11:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WordPress.tv: Brian Casel: Building Your Niche Freelance Business With WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19665";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/06/09/brian-casel-building-your-niche-freelance-business-with-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:710:"<div id="v-feHnr6Fp-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19665/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19665/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19665&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/06/09/brian-casel-building-your-niche-freelance-business-with-wordpress/"><img alt="Brian Casel: Building Your Niche Freelance Business With WordPress" src="http://videos.videopress.com/feHnr6Fp/video-85c225c8b6_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 09 Jun 2013 13:26:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WordPress.tv: Michael McKinnon: Hackers Ahoy!

Unfortunately, the plugin I used in the past was no longer available but it&#8217;s how I found that out that was the interesting thing. While the plugin was listed, the description said the plugin was empty and no long available. Just for giggles, I tried to install the plugin and nothing happened. Upon looking at the <a href="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/431935/delete-post-revisions" title="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/431935/delete-post-revisions">Trac changes for the plugin</a>, the last thing the plugin author did was delete all the files. After getting in touch with Otto about the plugin showing up in search results, he removed it but told me it wasn&#8217;t the proper way to go about closing a plugin down. So what is the proper way?</p>\n<h2>How To Orphan A Plugin:</h2>\n<p>Plugin authors have the ability to not only add other authors to the commit team but also hand over the entire plugin to someone else. Removing all the code related to the plugin is frowned upon because someone else could use that code either as a fork or the foundation for a similar type of plugin. But if you really want to have your plugin removed from the repository, sending an email to plugins@wordpress.org with your request should do the trick. If a plugin author decides to orphan a plugin that I&#8217;m using, I would really appreciate it if in the last update, somewhere within the readme or change log it stated that it would be the last version released and that it would no longer be supported. This would give ample opportunity for me to look at alternative plugins. </p>\n<h2>Adopting A Plugin:</h2>\n<p>There currently is no official way to adopt someone&#8217;s plugin. There has been some discussion in the past about creating an orphaned plugin program but those ideas never materialized. One of the reasons why the program never saw the light of day is because there were so few people wanting to adopt a plugin. Otto recommends trying to contact the author, and if that fails, email the plugins team plugins@wordpress.org. Show that you have code changes already made, as a good will thing, because what we don&#8217;t want is somebody taking over a plugin and making just superficial changes while putting their own name on it, sort of thing. So the plugins team verifies the code, tries to contact the original author, wait a reasonable time, etc. </p>\n<h2>WP Recycle:</h2>\n<p>There used to be a third party site that dealt exclusively with abandoned plugins called <a href="http://www.noupe.com/wordpress/wp-recycle-fresh-perpectives-for-starving-wordpress-plugins-73451.html" title="http://www.noupe.com/wordpress/wp-recycle-fresh-perpectives-for-starving-wordpress-plugins-73451.html">WPRecycle</a>. It was an offs_devhoot of Pluginchief.com but it looks like the website has since gone offline. I&#8217;m going to try to get in touch with those behind WPRecycle to figure out why the program failed or why the site has gone offline. </p>\n<p>While researching for this post, I came across <a href="http://digwp.com/2012/10/abandoned-plugin-adoption-program/" title="http://digwp.com/2012/10/abandoned-plugin-adoption-program/">an article</a> published by Matt Jones on the Digwp website. Even though it was a pitch for the WPRecycle program, he <a href="http://digwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/infographic-abandoned-wp-plugins.jpg" title="http://digwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/infographic-abandoned-wp-plugins.jpg">came up with a stat that</a> showed 1/3 of the plugin repository at that time had the 2 year update warning. I wonder what those numbers are like today with 25,369 plugins in the repository.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that a plugin update can occur with no code changes taking place. If only a readme file of a plugin was changed this would count as an update and would reset the 2 year warning. </p>\n<h2>Just What Is Abandonment?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to talk about plugin abandonment because there are no hard set rules that dictate when a plugin is officially abandoned. This was one of the biggest problems the core team faced when they discussed the requirements needed for a plugin to reach this status. A plugin with good code that doesn&#8217;t need to be updated for extended periods of time could be considered abandoned even though it wouldn&#8217;t be. </p>\n<p>Do you think orphaned plugins is a growing concern or is there a natural process in place that prevents this from ever becoming a serious problem? I would only consider it a serious problem if we reach a statistic where 50% or more of the plugins in the repository are abandoned. However, what if the total amount of plugins in the repository is 50,000 and 50% of those are dead? That still leaves us with 25,000 active plugins. What would the numbers have to be for a tipping point of users not finding the extensibility that has helped make WordPress as popular as it is today?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue this conversation in the comments. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/GXyv4sYRk-s" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Jun 2013 13:26:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 06:10:35 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"189304";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 05:45:34 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130604105221";}', 'no');

Jessica has spent a good chunk of the past couple weeks working on rewriting the templates &#8212; based on feedback we&#8217;d received from support requests and beta testers alike &#8212; to make them more flexible.</p>\n<p>In our talk this morning, Jessica walked through the changes she&#8217;s made and what you can expect from them. This is the first under-the-hood preview we&#8217;ve given so far and it should shed some light on what you can expect. Check out the video (less than 5 minutes long!) after the jump.</p>\n<p><span id="more-48462"></span></p>\n<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vQQjdWh135k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Pretty cool, right? Let&#8217;s review, using list view as our example to keep continuity with the video&#8230;</p>\n<h3><strong>What&#8217;s changing and how the file is broken up</strong></h3>\n<p>In the old list view, everything was in one file. It started with a wrapper, led into the header and the loop from there. The event single item was a big chunk of code within the list and repeated for every item in the event list; it would generate the same HTML for every event in the list. Underneath, it had the next/previous navigation and the iCal link. The big takeaway here should be that everything was all in one file.</p>\n<p>In the 3.0 release, list view is still in the same location: <em>plugin folder &#8211;&gt; views &#8211;&gt; list.php</em>. But if you go into <em>events &#8211;&gt; views</em>, you&#8217;ll see a list.php (the file that gets included first for list view &#8212; essentially the parent view file). Inside it, little pieces are called to handle each part of the view: for example, a template part for the tribe bar. We&#8217;ve included a new function: <strong>tribe_get_template_part. </strong>That is really similar to WordPress&#8217; get_template_part function, and it looks in all the correct locations for tri.be templates. You&#8217;ll see includes like <strong>(&#8216;modules/bar&#8217;)</strong>, etc. The loop is also now in a separate file.</p>\n<p>As an example: if you just wanted to add a div that wraps around the whole list, your approach will change in 3.0. Previously you would have been forced to copy the entire list file and make your changes there. But now you can merely copy this new file and leave the loop content alone, as it&#8217;s now included separately.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to do an override</strong></h3>\n<p>Overrides, then, have changed as well. You only have to override the piece you want to change &#8212; not the whole thing. Let&#8217;s say we want to override the list view so the next/previous links that appear before the loop were gone. To do this an override in the 3.0 codebase you&#8217;ll follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 13px;">Create a new &#8220;tribe-events&#8221; folder in your theme directory.</span></li>\n<li>In that &#8220;tribe-events&#8221; folder, make a new folder called &#8220;list&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Inside the &#8220;list&#8221; folder, make a file called &#8220;nav.php&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Copy the contents of &#8220;nav.php&#8221; from the original &#8220;views&#8221; folder to your new file of the same name. (Note that we&#8217;re not copying the whole list.php file, as was the case previously).</li>\n<li>Delete the nav-centric code from this file and replace it with something simple; for example, a basic line of text saying &#8220;There is no nav.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Save the file, and refresh the frontend. Your navigation links will be replaced by that text we added.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that the rest of the template is untouched, and still pulling from the original plugin files. So when updates are released people will not need to update the entire list.php; they can keep using the version we&#8217;ve released and if they made modifications to the nav or any other small overrides, that&#8217;s all they&#8217;ll have to be responsible for maintaining.</p>\n<p>One last point to keep in mind: in the old version, there was a lot of logic in the templates. This could be confusing for themers or other laymen, and made it a bit tough to scan as well. But for 3.0 we&#8217;ve moved a lot of that logic to template tags. So all you&#8217;ll have to do is throw out one template tag that does all this logic for you. Ultimately this means the templates themselves are also cleaner/simpler.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about anything else related to the templating structure, or if this raised questions in your mind that need an answer, let us know in the comments below.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://tri.be/the-events-calendar-3-0-preview-talking-templates-with-jessica/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"23";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"Getting to know you: why we’re talking to our users";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://tri.be/getting-to-know-you-why-were-talking-to-our-users/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://tri.be/getting-to-know-you-why-were-talking-to-our-users/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 May 2013 17:28:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"News & Announcements";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"http://tri.be/?p=48210";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:590:"We&#8217;re finding that there&#8217;s a lot to be learned from talking to your users.

(If you haven&#8217;t replied yet, what better time than now?). But we&#8217;ve also got a batch of conversations scheduled next week in place of May&#8217;s usability test, which should help paint an even better picture.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week I sent an email to three distinct groups of users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">The last 100 people to purchase a plugin</span></li>\n<li>100 users whose licenses expired over the past couple months who have not renewed</li>\n<li>50 or so users who have bought 4 or more licenses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal was simple: we wanted to schedule about a dozen 20-minute sessions throughout the morning of May 17, talking to a cross-section of these three groups to see what we could find out. This wasn&#8217;t intended a science experiment or a case study; it&#8217;s a casual conversation. But even pitching it as such  &#8211; and with the offer of a free license/upgrade to sweeten the deal &#8212; we wondered how much response we&#8217;d get. Our estimate was maybe 5% but not much higher than that.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, we got one hell of a response. All 12 of the slots were booked within far less than 24 hours, and I&#8217;m still four days later turning away people who are replying with interest. Even more surprising, we had just as many expired users reply as we did recent buyers.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited about what this means for the quality of our conversations next week, and even more excited about where the results of these conversations will take us. We&#8217;re going to let the flow naturally but do have a script we&#8217;ll stick to if things go off course, which includes questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What role does events play in the stuff you&#8217;re working on?</li>\n<li>What do you look at when deciding on a calendar?</li>\n<li>Do you pick this for your clients? Or do the clients pick it with you?</li>\n<li>Do you crack the hood? What are your expectations when doing so? How do you use documentation? Did you? What were you expecting to see that you didn&#8217;t?</li>\n<li>How did we make you more profitable? Did we? Is there other stuff we could build that you could sell?

Your frontend users will be able to narrow down by venue, organizer, category and a whole slew of other options using a sidebar panel that matches the design of the overall calendar.

In terms of filtering options available to site admins right off the bat, you&#8217;ve got:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style="line-height: 13px;">Event Category</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cost ($)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Tags</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Venues</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Organizers</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Day</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Time</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Distance</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those, coupled with the options in the event bar (which do interact with the filters panel) should give your users plenty of options. As users enable a given filter, those will take effect on the frontend immediately &#8212; assuming the live AJAX is enabled. If it isn&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll be prompted to hit a &#8220;Submit&#8221; button&#8230;which certainly isn&#8217;t the end of the world.</p>\n<p>A few things you should keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Organizers and venues list your 5 most-used of each. This means that as you use certain venues/organizers with increased or decreased frequency, that change will be reflected on the frontend panel immediately.</span></li>\n<li>The distance filter will not appear &#8212; even if it&#8217;s been enabled &#8212; until a geographic location has been entered into the &#8220;Location&#8221; field in the events bar.</li>\n<li>Filtering selections also modify the URL, which means you can pre-define filters before you send someone a link to the site. Have a friend coming to town who only likes live music? Filter to just show the live music category, on the days of the week she&#8217;ll be in town, then send her the link for perusal. She won&#8217;t have to apply those filters since your auto-generated URL took care of that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t want a given filtering choice available on the frontend? Want them appearing in a different order, with labels that you&#8217;ve personally added? Both are easily configured under <em>Events &#8211;&gt; Settings &#8212; &gt; Filters</em>. You can also change the category dropdown from a multiselect to a dropdown (or vice versa) on this page.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re really excited to get this plugin out there. As I mentioned in the video, it should ship alongside the 3.0 release and WILL be a separate add-on.

The sting of rejection failed to deter Camden from his cyborgly pursuits &#8211; he went on to sell over $1500 in imaginary weapons on Second Life when he was in middle school. Camden moved on to serve as the Systems Administrator for Woodrow Wilson High School, where he definitely did not go out to lunch on duty.

Her talk is on Saturday, June 8th at 11:00 AM.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong> -</p>\n<blockquote><p>Attention to detail in your code and design work is important – but before you lay down one single pixel, install your first plugin or one single line of code, you need to make sure that everyone (you, your client, your clients client, etc) are on the same page and make sure you are managing expectations on what the desired project outcome is. Learn how to dissect projects – either web site or plugin development – to determine the best approach to meet your client needs.</p>\n<p>This 45 minute covers hard lessons I’ve learned in a decade of client work – I hope to pass those headaches on to you so you don’t make the same mistakes. Q/A welcome, afterwards.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As always, Lisa is excited to share her knowledge with those she&#8217;s met and those she hasn&#8217;t!

He also dabbled in some super basic HTML on Geocities using Notepad. Throughout high school he worked part-time at the local radio station. Greg landed his first real job in early 2000 as Assistant Webmaster at Midwest Communications in Green Bay, WI.</p>\n<p>After a change in job and a move to Alabama, he started his own web design agency called “Wildfire Productions”. He helped clients of the radio station who didn’t have a web site, build one to tie in with their radio commercials. Greg&#8217;s company was bought out after a successful run and he was made Partner at VeriQik Technology, where he learned about WordPress and Joomla!</p>\n<p>In 2010 he started a new job as Chief Technology Officer at Bluewater Broadcasting in Montgomery, Alabama. In 2011, Greg started using the Genesis Framework for his PSD conversions and was promoted to Chief Engineer.</p>\n<p>Finally, after three and half years at Bluewater, he accepted the position as Front-end Developer here at WebDevStudios! He&#8217;ll be working on converting client websites from Photoshop into custom themes. Greg is thrilled about no longer being on-call or having to worry about something at the radio station breaking while He&#8217;s on vacation!</p>\n<p>He says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m very excited to be a part of an agency that is on the forefront of both technology and community. They encourage us to contribute to WordPress, which I think is a great attitude to have toward a product that allows all of us to have cool jobs!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Outside of work, he&#8217;s married to his beautiful wife Tara, and father to a crazy kid named Chase. He loves to cook, enjoy the outdoors, including duck hunting, fishing and camping. Greg is a huge Green Bay Packers fan and loves to play Call of Duty on the Xbox!</p>\n<p>Welcome to the team Greg!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://webdevstudios.com/2013/05/29/wds-welcomes-greg-rickaby-to-our-team/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:66:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"How to set up SSL with OSX Mountain Lion’s built-in Apache";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://webdevstudios.com/2013/05/24/how-to-set-up-ssl-with-osx-mountain-lions-built-in-apache/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"http://webdevstudios.com/2013/05/24/how-to-set-up-ssl-with-osx-mountain-lions-built-in-apache/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 May 2013 19:38:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:9:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"How To";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Tutorial";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Apache";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"https";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"local development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"localhost";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Mountain Lion";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"OSX";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"SSL";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=7462";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:437:"There are many tutorials out there, but for whatever reason I couldn&#8217;t get it work after a first pass.

That line should look like:\n<pre><code>SSLCertificateFile "/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.crt"</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Do the same with the &#8216;<strong>SSLCertificateKeyFile</strong>&#8216; line:\n<pre><code>SSLCertificateKeyFile "/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.key"</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>In the same file comment out (add a # to the beginning of the line) the &#8216;<strong>SSLCACertificatePath</strong>&#8216; and &#8216;<strong>SSLCARevocationPath</strong>&#8216; lines if they&#8217;re not already.</li>\n<li>Save the file. (OSX may ask for your admin password)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Open Terminal app -&gt; Read below caveats, then <a title="How to create a self-signed SSL Certificate" href="http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html" target="_blank">follow instructions here</a>\n<ol>\n<li>Each step has a singular line of dark bold text.. that is text you will paste into terminal and hit enter (copy the text exactly, not including white space or line breaks). The blue text below is an example of what terminal will output. (After pasting the line from step 2, terminal will walk you through the certificate&#8217;s necessary info. Whatever you put should be fine.. just hit enter after answering)</li>\n<li>On step 5, replace &#8216;<b>/usr/local/apache/conf/ssl.crt</b>&#8216; with the path to the location of the new &#8216;ssl&#8217; folder you created in finder: <strong>/private/etc/apache2</strong>. So this will look like:\n<pre><code>/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.crt</code></pre>\n<p>Do the same with the ssl.key line. Replace:</p>\n<pre><code>/usr/local/apache/conf/ssl.key</code></pre>\n<p>with:</p>\n<pre><code>/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.key</code></pre>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed, these values need to line up exactly with the paths you put in the &#8217;<strong>httpd-ssl.conf</strong>&#8216; file.</li>\n<li>Skip step 6 (it&#8217;s already done), and step 7.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>At this point, you should be able to go to <a title="localhost" href="https://localhost" target="_blank">https://localhost</a> and see it working. If you&#8217;re using a good browser, you&#8217;ll probably be warned about the authenticity of the certificate, but unless you have trust issues with yourself, you can ignore the errors. You&#8217;ll probably also notice other indications that you&#8217;re not using a known certificate, but again, you don&#8217;t need to worry about them.\n<p><div id="attachment_3909" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 106px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3909" alt="https-warning" src="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/https-warning.png" width="96" height="44" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chrome&#8217;s notification</p></div></li>\n</ol>\n<p>*Note: from <a title="Using SSL for your local development" href="https://www.servage.net/blog/2011/05/19/using-ssl-for-your-local-development/" target="_blank">Using SSL for your local development</a>, Beware that Apache only supports one SSL domain per IP.

WordPress is what we do!  All of our owners at WDS have been using WordPress for quite some time. <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/team/brian-messenlehner/">Brian Messenlehner</a> and <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/team/brad-williams/">Brad Williams </a>have been using the platform since early 2006, whereas, <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/team/lisa-sabin-wilson/">Lisa Sabin-Wilson</a> has been using WordPress since it&#8217;s release in 2003.</p>\n<p>In celebration of the <strong>10th anniversary</strong>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> has decided to have a little fun. They would like all of us &#8211; users, developers, designers.. everyone &#8211; to throw a party! Using <a href="http://www.meetup.com/everywhere/">Meetup Everywhere</a>, we can plan a party and invite people from all over. The process for setting up these parties is easy -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a place to go where a bunch of people can be merry — a park, a bar, a backyard, whatever</li>\n<li>Spread the word to local meetups, tech groups, press, etc and get people to say they’ll come to your party</li>\n<li>If 50 or more people RSVP to your party, we’ll try to send you some WordPress stickers and buttons</li>\n<li>Have party attendees post photos, videos, and the like with the #wp10 hashtag</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can register your city and party on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/">official Meetup Everywhere 10th anniversary </a>site.

From cell phones to Twitter updates, Facebook to YouTube, teens have both grown up in and created a culture that has redefined what it means to connect. Scott understands.

On any given day, he can be found not only speaking on stages around North America, but also answering questions as a highly sought-after teen advice expert.

While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-2', '', '', '2013-06-14 09:54:12', '2013-06-14 09:54:12', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-3', '', '', '2013-06-17 11:32:15', '2013-06-17 11:32:15', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear. Student athletes are making the newspaper with increasing regularity, but unfortunately they are appearing in the wrong section of the paper. Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-7', '', '', '2013-06-17 11:29:19', '2013-06-17 11:29:19', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In one moment, students are laughing hysterically, moving actively on their feet, and shouting “ROCK ON!” at the top of their lungs. Yet only minutes later, that same room is silent; students find themselves hanging on to every word of Scott’s heartfelt and challenging message. It is at this point that the students in attendance realize they are no longer watching a presentation to an audience of hundreds or even thousands—they are hearing their own personal call to action.\r\n\r\n“Scott is different because he doesn’t demand anything. He simply asks students what they should be demanding from themselves and from each other… getting them to aspire to a higher calling, a higher purpose.  Scott’s speech laid the groundwork for our entire leadership program.”\r\n- Craig Sutphin, Director of Student Leadership, St. Mary’s HS, Berkeley, CA\r\n\r\nScott gets that students have a HUGE impact on those around them—from their casual acquaintances at school to the close friends they see virtually 24/7. Each and every student has the power to influence their world in some way, shape, or form. Before changing anything, though, each student must undoubtedly recognize that the world in which they live is not perfect by any means. It takes passion and determination to make it a better place.\r\nRegardless of the situation, capacity, or context, the only way students will truly change their circumstances is if they decide to be a catalyst—someone who changes the status quo.\r\n\r\nPast Speech Topics / Workshops Include\r\nRespect\r\nSchool Spirit\r\nIssue Awareness\r\nStandardized Testing\r\nFreshman Orientation\r\nSenior Institute Days\r\nBullying\r\nPublic Speaking\r\nStudent Activity Planning\r\nand many more…\r\n\r\n', 'Scott Backovich', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '119-revision-9', '', '', '2013-06-17 11:35:23', '2013-06-17 11:35:23', '', 119, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/119-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-4', '', '', '2013-06-19 11:06:19', '2013-06-19 11:06:19', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear.

Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-8', '', '', '2013-06-19 11:09:05', '2013-06-19 11:09:05', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear. Student athletes are making the newspaper with increasing regularity, but unfortunately they are appearing in the wrong section of the paper. Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-9', '', '', '2013-06-21 13:27:47', '2013-06-21 13:27:47', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-7', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:22:47', '2013-06-21 14:22:47', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

She explains that although many funny things have happened to her since she has been in a wheelchair, there is nothing humorous about how she lost her freedom to stand tall and walk. Tiana continues to capture the audience as she shares her recovery journey -- the victories and the setbacks. Skillfully, she then challenges the student''s complacency towards the legal drug of alcohol.\r\nAfter sharing her hospital stories, Tiana illustrates the power of choices through role playing with audience volunteers. She speaks about the unimportance of physical looks, emphasizing the importance of actions and behavior. Tiana will affirm everyone''s power to make choices and then challenges them to accept responsibility for their choices -- past and those to come.\r\nTiana offers unique insight into what happens after the party. She has spoken at hundreds of high schools for MADD, she has presented at student leadership conferences, judicial conferences, pre-prom and Red Ribbon Week programs, and she lobbied for the .08 law in Idaho, Illinois and Nevada.\r\nIn "Taking the Stairs" Tiana can focus on:\r\n•	Drinking and Driving \r\n•	Drug Use \r\n•	Peer Pressure \r\n•	Self-Image \r\n•	Athletes and Alcohol \r\n•	Responsible Choices \r\n•	General Motivation \r\n•       Student Leadership\r\n', 'Tiana Tozer ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '155-revision-8', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:22:45', '2013-06-21 14:22:45', '', 155, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/155-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear. Student athletes are making the newspaper with increasing regularity, but unfortunately they are appearing in the wrong section of the paper. Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-10', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:23:22', '2013-06-21 14:23:22', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-10/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In one moment, students are laughing hysterically, moving actively on their feet, and shouting “ROCK ON!” at the top of their lungs. Yet only minutes later, that same room is silent; students find themselves hanging on to every word of Scott’s heartfelt and challenging message. It is at this point that the students in attendance realize they are no longer watching a presentation to an audience of hundreds or even thousands—they are hearing their own personal call to action.\r\n\r\n“Scott is different because he doesn’t demand anything. He simply asks students what they should be demanding from themselves and from each other… getting them to aspire to a higher calling, a higher purpose.  Scott’s speech laid the groundwork for our entire leadership program.”\r\n- Craig Sutphin, Director of Student Leadership, St. Mary’s HS, Berkeley, CA\r\n\r\nScott gets that students have a HUGE impact on those around them—from their casual acquaintances at school to the close friends they see virtually 24/7.

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear. Student athletes are making the newspaper with increasing regularity, but unfortunately they are appearing in the wrong section of the paper. Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-11', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:31:49', '2013-06-21 14:31:49', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-11/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-8', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:30:37', '2013-06-21 14:30:37', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear.

Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-12', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:40:52', '2013-06-21 14:40:52', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-12/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color.

Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-9', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:41:10', '2013-06-21 14:41:10', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Her talk is on Saturday, June 8th at 11:00 AM.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong> -</p>\n<blockquote><p>Attention to detail in your code and design work is important – but before you lay down one single pixel, install your first plugin or one single line of code, you need to make sure that everyone (you, your client, your clients client, etc) are on the same page and make sure you are managing expectations on what the desired project outcome is. Learn how to dissect projects – either web site or plugin development – to determine the best approach to meet your client needs.</p>\n<p>This 45 minute covers hard lessons I’ve learned in a decade of client work – I hope to pass those headaches on to you so you don’t make the same mistakes. Q/A welcome, afterwards.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As always, Lisa is excited to share her knowledge with those she&#8217;s met and those she hasn&#8217;t!

He also dabbled in some super basic HTML on Geocities using Notepad. Throughout high school he worked part-time at the local radio station. Greg landed his first real job in early 2000 as Assistant Webmaster at Midwest Communications in Green Bay, WI.</p>\n<p>After a change in job and a move to Alabama, he started his own web design agency called “Wildfire Productions”. He helped clients of the radio station who didn’t have a web site, build one to tie in with their radio commercials. Greg&#8217;s company was bought out after a successful run and he was made Partner at VeriQik Technology, where he learned about WordPress and Joomla!</p>\n<p>In 2010 he started a new job as Chief Technology Officer at Bluewater Broadcasting in Montgomery, Alabama. In 2011, Greg started using the Genesis Framework for his PSD conversions and was promoted to Chief Engineer.</p>\n<p>Finally, after three and half years at Bluewater, he accepted the position as Front-end Developer here at WebDevStudios! He&#8217;ll be working on converting client websites from Photoshop into custom themes. Greg is thrilled about no longer being on-call or having to worry about something at the radio station breaking while He&#8217;s on vacation!</p>\n<p>He says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m very excited to be a part of an agency that is on the forefront of both technology and community.

In my case I put the path to my WordPress installation I needed to test. Something like:\n<pre><code>DocumentRoot /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Sites/WordPress</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Make sure &#8216;<strong>ServerName</strong>&#8216; line looks like:\n<pre><code>ServerName localhost</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>modify &#8216;<strong>ServerAdmin</strong>&#8216; line to use one of your email addresses. (I doubt this is necessary)</li>\n<li>Take note of the line &#8216;<strong>ErrorLog</strong>&#8216;. You can use the location listed there to &#8220;Go to folder&#8221; in finder and view the log if things don&#8217;t work.

That line should look like:\n<pre><code>SSLCertificateFile "/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.crt"</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Do the same with the &#8216;<strong>SSLCertificateKeyFile</strong>&#8216; line:\n<pre><code>SSLCertificateKeyFile "/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.key"</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>In the same file comment out (add a # to the beginning of the line) the &#8216;<strong>SSLCACertificatePath</strong>&#8216; and &#8216;<strong>SSLCARevocationPath</strong>&#8216; lines if they&#8217;re not already.</li>\n<li>Save the file. (OSX may ask for your admin password)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Open Terminal app -&gt; Read below caveats, then <a title="How to create a self-signed SSL Certificate" href="http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html" target="_blank">follow instructions here</a>\n<ol>\n<li>Each step has a singular line of dark bold text.. that is text you will paste into terminal and hit enter (copy the text exactly, not including white space or line breaks). The blue text below is an example of what terminal will output. (After pasting the line from step 2, terminal will walk you through the certificate&#8217;s necessary info. Whatever you put should be fine.. just hit enter after answering)</li>\n<li>On step 5, replace &#8216;<b>/usr/local/apache/conf/ssl.crt</b>&#8216; with the path to the location of the new &#8216;ssl&#8217; folder you created in finder: <strong>/private/etc/apache2</strong>. So this will look like:\n<pre><code>/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.crt</code></pre>\n<p>Do the same with the ssl.key line. Replace:</p>\n<pre><code>/usr/local/apache/conf/ssl.key</code></pre>\n<p>with:</p>\n<pre><code>/private/etc/apache2/ssl/ssl.key</code></pre>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed, these values need to line up exactly with the paths you put in the &#8217;<strong>httpd-ssl.conf</strong>&#8216; file.</li>\n<li>Skip step 6 (it&#8217;s already done), and step 7.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>At this point, you should be able to go to <a title="localhost" href="https://localhost" target="_blank">https://localhost</a> and see it working. If you&#8217;re using a good browser, you&#8217;ll probably be warned about the authenticity of the certificate, but unless you have trust issues with yourself, you can ignore the errors. You&#8217;ll probably also notice other indications that you&#8217;re not using a known certificate, but again, you don&#8217;t need to worry about them.\n<p><div id="attachment_3909" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 106px"><img class="size-full wp-image-3909" alt="https-warning" src="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/https-warning.png" width="96" height="44" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chrome&#8217;s notification</p></div></li>\n</ol>\n<p>*Note: from <a title="Using SSL for your local development" href="https://www.servage.net/blog/2011/05/19/using-ssl-for-your-local-development/" target="_blank">Using SSL for your local development</a>, Beware that Apache only supports one SSL domain per IP.

Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2856" style="margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0" alt="about-modern-wordpress" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2984" alt="responsive" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255" data-recalc-dims="1" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2954" alt="colors" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2967" alt="themes" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344" data-recalc-dims="1" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789" alt="The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg. This is our second release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. We think it’s been going great.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">on the make/core blog</a>.

The campaign was subsequently <a href="http://aesopstories.com/updates/campaign-update/" target="_blank">extended</a> with a vastly reduced goal of $6k and a new focus on polishing the story engine before moving on to the hosted version: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Because we did not raise the full amount, there’s a strong chance that the hosted version may not come to fruition. This wasn’t scheduled to happen until the Spring anyways, so there’s still a small chance it will pan out, however focus is being put on finishing the core story engine first.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Development on the project will now refocus to complete the story engine along with a couple of themes built specifically for Aesop. Haskins is getting the plugin ready for submission to the WordPress.org repository and is working towards building out the business and branding for the project. Those who have backed Aesop will receive access to the themes before they are released to the general public.</p>\n<h3>Storytelling is Not Dead</h3>\n<p>The successful funding of the Aesop project demonstrates how much potential this new tool has for revolutionizing storytelling on the web. Once the plugin is polished up, anyone will be able to easily create photo essays, novels, interviews and big visual posts with a user-friendly story editor and full design control. Publishers are looking for new ways to keep readers engaged, as the industry evolves to keep pace with the modern web. The Aesop storytelling engine makes it possible for WordPress, the world&#8217;s leading publishing platform, to keep the art of storytelling alive in the digital age.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 04:53:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: Industry Night #6 – Talking Shop with John Overall";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=15647";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:122:"http://wptavern.com/industry-night-6-john-overall?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=industry-night-6-john-overall";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1722:"<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-14203" alt="IndustryNight_albumart_2d" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IndustryNight_albumart_2d-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" />For more than two years, I&#8217;ve been in a weekly routine of co-hosting the <a title="WordPress Plugins A-Z" href="http://wppluginsatoz.com">WordPress Plugins A-Z</a> podcast with John Overall. Every week we talk about the latest and greatest in plugins. Sorting out the junk from the gems. We&#8217;re like the Siskel &amp; Ebert of plugins, giving our opinions on the newest plugins being released in the repository.</p>\n<p>Once the show is over though, we generally just set the meeting time for the next episode and hang up. This time however, I decided to take a rare opportunity to extend my time with John for a little WordPress &#8220;<em>shop talk</em>&#8220;. Like me, John has done hundreds of development projects. He&#8217;s seen just about everything that can (<strong>and will</strong>) go wrong with WordPress. John has done so much in WordPress that a majority of his business is providing emergency support. While so many people focus on the building of sites, John has specialized in fixing things that break in WordPress. You can call him any time, day or night and he&#8217;s there to rescue your WordPress install with emergency level support.</p>\n<p>In this episode we talk about the ten plugins that John installs on <span>every client site</span> and why simplicity is often the most difficult concept for clients to grasp. So pull up a chair, grab a cold one and join me in my conversation with <a title="http://www.johnoverall.com/" href="http://www.johnoverall.com/">John Overall</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 02:17:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: GovFresh WP: A Free WordPress Theme For Governments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=15597";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:158:"http://wptavern.com/govfresh-a-free-wordpress-theme-for-governments?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=govfresh-a-free-wordpress-theme-for-governments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3079:"<p>This week <a href="http://govfresh.com/" target="_blank">GovFresh</a>, a government and technology blog, launched a new WordPress theme project to help promote the use of open source software among governments. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever visited a local government website that looks like it hasn&#8217;t been updated since 1999, then you understand the problem that the folks at GovFresh are trying to tackle here. Many smaller cities do not have a technology budget to afford website consulting services and therefore get left behind. It&#8217;s mind boggling to see how widespread this problem is, given all the user-friendly open source technology available these days.</p>\n<p>The deplorable state of government websites inspired Luke Fretwell to develop <a href="http://wp.govfresh.com/" target="_blank">GovFresh WP</a>, a free WordPress theme for governments. </p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/govfreshwp.png" rel="prettyphoto[15597]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/govfreshwp.png" alt="govfreshwp" width="671" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15633" /></a></p>\n<p>GovFresh WP is a starter theme based on Bootstrap and features all the basics for building a modern website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile-friendly and adapts to all devices (PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone)</li>\n<li>Custom header and background images</li>\n<li>Homepage, sidebar, footer widgets</li>\n<li>Data portability &#8211; change the design and never lose your content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also comes with a <a href="http://wp.govfresh.com/plugins/" target="_blank">list of recommended plugins</a> to help those administering government websites to get started, including solutions for performance and caching, workflow, analytics, security, SEO and more.  </p>\n<h3>Calling on WordPress Developers to Help</h3>\n<p>Luke Fretwell is looking for help from the WordPress developer community and GovFresh WP is now available on <a href="https://github.com/govfresh/govfreshwp" target="_blank">github</a>. He wants to improve the theme and incorporate <a href="http://govfresh.uservoice.com/forums/238740-govfresh-wp" target="_blank">new ideas</a>, which will require some rebuilding of his code. </p>\n<p>The project currently has two pilot cities, <a href="http://cityofdeleon.org/" target="_blank">De Leon, TX</a> and <a href="http://cityofferndale.org/" target="_blank">Ferndale, WA</a>, running on the theme, and there are plans in the works to offer support for small city web operations. It would be exciting if the theme had some support for incorporating <a href="http://wptavern.com/data-gov-is-using-wordpress-and-all-the-code-is-open-source" target="_blank">open data features</a> into the website in the case of cities or agencies. If you can help to further develop GovFresh WP or have suggestions to improve it, get in touch with Luke Fretwell at <a href="http://govfresh.com/contact" target="_blank">GovFresh</a>.

Over the past several months we&#8217;ve featured a number of plugins that are vying for the best way to edit content on the front end. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sir-trevor-wp/" target="_blank">Sir Trevor WP</a> is a new plugin that presents an alternative way to edit content within the admin.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s based on <a href="http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/" target="_blank">Sir Trevor JS</a>, a rich content editor that claims not to presuppose anything about how the content will be rendered. Sir Trevor content is made up of blocks that are easy to edit. It ships with a handful of default content blocks but is also extensible if you want to add your own:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sirtrevorjs.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14852]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sirtrevorjs.jpg" alt="sirtrevorjs" width="940" height="182" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15605" /></a></p>\n<p>The Sir Trever WP plugin brings these intuitive block types into the WordPress content editor, making it easy for anyone to understand how to add content. When you install the plugin, it is turned on by default for all new posts, but you will retain the option to use the normal editor at any time via a strategically placed button. Here&#8217;s what Sir Trevor WP looks like in the post editor:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sir-trevor-wp1.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14852]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sir-trevor-wp1.jpg" alt="sir-trevor-wp" width="739" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15610" /></a></p>\n<p>Selecting the Text block gives you what you need to input text:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/text-block.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14852]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/text-block.jpg" alt="text-block" width="833" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15612" /></a></p>\n<p>Selecting &#8220;Image&#8221; provides an upload interface that bypasses the normal WordPress media dialog.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sir-trevor-media.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14852]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sir-trevor-media.jpg" alt="sir-trevor-media" width="777" height="496" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15614" /></a></p>\n<h3>Testing Sir Trevor WP</h3>\n<p>If you want to test out this plugin, the most important thing to remember is that you will need to start a new post in order to see it in action. If you go to edit your old posts, Sir Trevor will not be an option.</p>\n<p>No time to test on your own server? Check out an animated gif of the plugin in action.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sirtrevor.gif" rel="prettyphoto[14852]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sirtrevor.gif" alt="sirtrevor" width="384" height="280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15608" /></a></p>\n<p>You can also try out the <a href="http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/example.html" target="_blank">live interactive demo</a> of the editor on the Sir Trevor JS site.</p>\n<p>While testing the plugin, I found that it certainly could use a little polishing. Adding images is currently very slow and may not work at all. Also, you will not be able to edit previously created posts in the Sir Trevor editor. This may ultimately be an impossibility given how it stores content. Errors on content blocks could also be a little more explanatory. For example, a user might receive the following error &#8220;List block is invalid&#8221;, but there is no explanation to help the user find a way forward. Unless you&#8217;re willing to experiment quite a bit, it&#8217;s not as user-friendly as it seems from the outset.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sir-trevor-wp/" target="_blank">Sir Trevor WP</a> plugin probably isn&#8217;t ready for a production environment at present, but I love the fact that its creator is exploring new ways to improve the WordPress publishing experience. It reminds me of all of the things that were appealing about the <a href="http://wptavern.com/mark-jaquith-on-wordpress-3-6-postmortem-and-post-formats-ui" target="_blank">Post Formats UI</a> feature the WordPress community explored in 3.6. The challenge of simplifying WordPress&#8217; powerful publishing capabilities still remains.  Sir Trevor WP tackles that with a new way of presenting the editor. Hopefully, the surrounding discussion can spark some new ideas for the future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 19:53:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WPTavern: WordPress, Openness, and Communication";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=15519";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:136:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-openness-and-communication?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-openness-and-communication";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7956:"<p>One of the battles the WordPress.org project has faced since its inception is communication. Not just how much or how little but also the tools used to communicate. When I followed the development of WordPress with eagle eyes from <strong>2008-2011</strong>, I used all of the communication channels that were available. IRC, the WordPress development blog, the WordPress.org forum, mailing lists, blogs about WordPress, and wherever else discussion on the core of WordPress took place. </p>\n<p>There were times when WordPress appeared to be a completely transparent project. There were also instances when changes took place that were <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit" title="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/07/08/lowercase-p-dangit">not communicated very well to the community</a> that caused more harm than good. </p>\n<div id="attachment_15569" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15519]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg" alt="Communication Featured Image" width="637" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-15569" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elycefeliz/3224486233/">elycefeliz</a>  &#8211;  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<h3>Four Examples Of Communication Within WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Siobhan McKeown, author of the <a title="http://wordpress.org/about/history/" href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">WordPress history book</a> has <a title="http://siobhanmckeown.com/degrees-of-openness-communication-in-the-wordpress-community/" href="http://siobhanmckeown.com/degrees-of-openness-communication-in-the-wordpress-community/">published a great post</a> that looks at the openness and types of communication used within the WordPress.org project. She specifically highlights four different projects within WordPress. They are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shuttle &#8211; Admin redesign project between WordPress 1.5 and 2.3</li>\n<li>Redesign of the backend using design agency Happy Cog</li>\n<li>Redesign of the backend immediately after 2.5 codenamed Crazyhorse</li>\n<li>Redesign of the backend codenamed MP6</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WordPress 2.5 Morphs Into Crazyhorse</h3>\n<p>I was one of the first to publicly view <a title="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">WordPress 2.5</a> redesigned by Happy Cog. It was released at WordCamp Dallas 2008 to cheers. Within a month, those cheers turned into boos. To the surprise of many including myself, the <a title="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/usability-testing-report-25-and-crazyhorse/" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/usability-testing-report-25-and-crazyhorse/">Crazyhorse project was announced</a> soon after the release of 2.5.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whereas the 2.5 redesign was done behind closed doors, a lot of work was done in the Crazyhorse to keep the community up to date. Significantly, a number of the key developers at that time feel that it was one of the project’s most exciting times, a point at which WordPress really grew up.</p></blockquote>\n<div id="attachment_15571" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WordPress27CrazyHorse.png" rel="prettyphoto[15519]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WordPress27CrazyHorse.png" alt="WordPress 2.7 Crazyhorse" width="597" height="402" class="size-full wp-image-15571" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 2.7 Unfinished Post Writing Panel</p></div>\n<p>I agree that Crazyhorse was one of the most exciting times for the WordPress project. It&#8217;s one of the few times I remember witnessing a strong devotion to get the community involved in all aspects of the project with surveys and usability reports. Jen Mylo did an awesome job gathering community feedback every step of the way. The communication channel she administered between core developers and users is one of the biggest reasons I believe WordPress 2.7 was so successful. </p>\n<h3>MP6 Development Using a Skype Back Channel</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mp6logo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15519]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mp6logo.jpg" alt="mp6 plugin header logo" width="206" height="197" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6888" /></a>MP6 was an interesting project to follow. Most of the communication surrounding the development of MP6 took place on a private Skype channel. Anyone could access the channel if they asked for permission but those chat logs are not searchable. They are not easily obtainable by anyone and it left many people wondering whether this type of communication is beneficial to the development of WordPress. </p>\n<p>During <a href="http://youtu.be/al_Saklwq48?t=41m15s" title="http://youtu.be/al_Saklwq48?t=41m15s">Matt&#8217;s State of The Word presentation in 2013</a>, Matt wasn&#8217;t sure whether the private channel on Skype was a good or bad thing. At the very least, reports of all of the changes that went into MP6 during the week were published on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/mp6/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/mp6/">Make.core.WordPress blog</a>. The reports gave those that didn&#8217;t have access to the Skype channel the chance to provide feedback and be part of the development process. </p>\n<div id="attachment_15574" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MP6Report.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15519]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MP6Report-500x283.jpg" alt="Standard Status Report Of MP6" width="500" height="283" class="size-large wp-image-15574" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Standard Status Report Of MP6</p></div>\n<h3>Reports Are Boring But Are Publicly Available</h3>\n<p>There are those who believe that to be truly open source, everything concerning the project should be transparent. Others are ok with back channel conversations as long as the results of those conversations are published in a public location. Thanks to the success of the MP6 model, features as plugins first and other aspects of core development are being published as reports on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">Make.Core.WordPress</a> site. Siobhan made an excellent point regarding all of these reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The downfall of all this reporting is that it changes the public tone of the project from a conversation between community members, to a list of reports. The updates blog is particularly report-heavy, though many of the other make blogs are becoming that way. Reports are boring to read. No one wants to read a hundred reports. People want to be part of the conversation. Commenting on a report of a conversation that has already taken place elsewhere doesn’t make you feel part of things.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Complex Problem With No Easy Solution</h3>\n<p>I agree that reports are <strong>BORING</strong>. However, I&#8217;m thankful that the information in those reports is publicly available since I can not be part of the conversation. All it takes for me to keep up with a project is to keep tabs on those reports. The biggest take away from Siobhan&#8217;s post is that there is no tool or service that solves all of the communication issues within WordPress.org.

Just three years ago, WordPress did not have much representation in the country at all. The success of the first Oslo WordPress meetup in May 6th, 2011, sparked more gatherings, including the first WordCamp Norway. There are now <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=wordpress+norway&radius=Infinity&userFreeform=Oslo%2C+Norway&sort=default" target="_blank">three official WordPress meetups</a> happening regularly in different parts of the country.</p>\n<p>This past weekend, Oslo hosted its <a href="http://2014.norway.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">3rd WordCamp</a> at the Radisson Blu Hotel and 150 attendees were greeted with snow. Most of the activities at this particular event were centered around the hotel and the nearby Metronet offices where the contributor day was held.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ag.png" rel="prettyphoto[15459]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ag.png" alt="ag" width="80" height="80" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15484" /></a>I had the chance to chat with <a href="http://aloisia.net/" target="_blank">Aloisia Gabat</a>, a WordPress developer and first time attendee who traveled from her home outside of Paris to join the event. Gabat attended <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-paris-2014-uniting-the-french-wordpress-community" target="_blank">WordCamp Paris</a> the previous weekend. &#8220;The two events were quite different,&#8221; she said, &#8220;But still represented all that I love about WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked her what she found to be unique in the Norwegian WordPress community. She found the diversity of people, countries, and disciplines to be remarkable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what strikes me is its openness, the diversity of disciplines, and how international it is. The part of the community I met comprises several nationalities, and attendees included designers, developers, business owners, bloggers, etc. Based on the attendance here, I would expect the larger Norwegian WordPress community to further reflect those characteristics.</p></blockquote>\n<p><div id="attachment_15470" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wcnorway-tshirts1.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15459]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wcnorway-tshirts1-300x300.jpg" alt="photo credit - Noel Tock" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-15470" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit &#8211; <a href="http://instagram.com/p/jlxaTWHCI0/" target="_blank">Noel Tock</a></p></div>\n<p>Almost 100% of the presentations were given in English, due to the international mix of attendees. Two tracks ran simultaneously and Gabat particularly enjoyed <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanhellyer" target="_blank">Ryan Hellyer</a>&#8216;s &#8220;My Experiences Learning WordPress Security&#8221; and <a href="https://twitter.com/cageNL" target="_blank">Barry Kooij</a>&#8216;s talk on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cageNL/plugin-development-wordcamp-norway-2014" target="_blank">Plugin Development</a>. &#8220;I can find most of the information presented scattered on the internet and offline in various forms,&#8221; she said, &#8220;But Barry covered the different aspects of developing a plugin, from tools to WordPress core functions and hooks to coding standards to security, in one succinct presentation.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Winter Fun on Contributor Day</h3>\n<p><div id="attachment_15532" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/contributor-day.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15459]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/contributor-day.jpg" alt="credit: @rarst" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-15532" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rarst/12180847314/sizes/z/in/set-72157640234422803/">@rarst</a></p></div>\n<p>During Contributor Day, participants engaged in a variety of tasks, including tickets, translations and BuddyPress support.</p>\n<p><a href="http://markoheijnen.com/" target="_blank">Marko Heijnen</a>, who has attended every WordCamp held in Norway, said that the community is always very welcoming to international attendees. &#8220;I guess they must be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Since it’s always really cold in the winter.&#8221; WordCamp Norway offered many opportunities for sitting around the fire and getting to know new friends. Attendees remarked on how nicely the venue&#8217;s lobby lent itself to group discussions during the after party. </p>\n<div id="attachment_15529" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fireplace.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15459]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fireplace.jpg" alt="credit: @rarst" width="640" height="342" class="size-full wp-image-15529" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rarst/12180422405/in/set-72157640234422803">@rarst</a></p></div>\n<p>After the contributor day a large group went to a restaurant on the Korketrekkeren hill. Since it was closed due to a private party, they decided on an impromptu sledding adventure down the hill instead of taking the metro. </p>\n<div id="attachment_15534" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/adventure.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15459]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/adventure.jpg" alt="credit: @rarst" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-15534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rarst/12180432875/in/set-72157640234422803" target="_blank">@rarst</a></p></div>\n<p>Overall, the third annual WordCamp Norway seems to have been a smashing success. While this winter event tends to be quite cold, the community is warm and welcoming. If sledding and fireside chats sound like the perfect WordCamp experience for you, consider adding this one to your calendar next year.

This collection includes just a few commands that have helped him with BuddyPress development but he welcomes your pull requests.</p>\n<p>So far, the commands include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>bp activate</strong> &#8212; Activate a component.</li>\n<li><strong>bp activity_create</strong> &#8212; Create a single activity item.</li>\n<li><strong>bp activity_generate</strong> &#8212; Generate a large number of random activity items.</li>\n<li><strong>bp deactivate</strong> &#8212; Deactivate a component.</li>\n<li><strong>bp group_create</strong> &#8212; Create new BuddyPress groups.</li>\n<li><strong>bp group_add_member</strong> &#8212; Add a member to a BuddyPress group.</li>\n<li><strong>bp member_generate</strong> &#8212; Create lots of site members, with the proper BP metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Setting up a BuddyPress test site can be fairly time consuming, especially if you need enough demo data to properly test all of the components. The WP-CLI commands included here will get your site populated with plenty of random activity items, groups and site members, including the proper BP metadata, in a matter of seconds. This is a big time saver for testing BuddyPress core, themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress community package can be found on <a href="https://github.com/boonebgorges/wp-cli-buddypress"

The launch of <a href="http://wptavern.com/apppresser-launches-first-mobile-app-development-framework-for-wordpress" target="_blank">AppPresser</a>, the first mobile application framework for WordPress, produced a healthy buzz around the idea and now the community is primed for more.</p>\n<p>Ryan Fugate, better known around the web as &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/modemlooper" target="_blank">@modemlooper</a>&#8220;, has created a WordPress-powered micro messaging app for mobile. <a href="http://taptappress.com/status-app/" target="_blank">Status App</a> is actually a WordPress plugin that creates a Twitter type micro blogging platform for mobile users at your chosen URL.</p>\n<p><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/status.png" alt="status" width="906" height="454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15390" /></p>\n<p>Want to try it? Visit this URL from a mobile browser: <a href="http://status.taptappress.com/status" target="_blank">http://status.taptappress.com/status</a></p>\n<p>The status updates are stored as a custom post type within WordPress and can be managed from the admin. Right now the app doesn&#8217;t include a settings panel. You simply activate the plugin and then visit your site on mobile. </p>\n<p><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/status-cpt.png" alt="status-cpt" width="985" height="302" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15403" /></p>\n<p>Since Status App is technically a social app, why didn&#8217;t he build it with BuddyPress? Ryan explained his reasoning when he <a href="http://taptappress.com/status-app/" target="_blank">introduced</a> the app: </p>\n<blockquote><p>This could have been an app for BuddyPress but I am targeting a different group of users. BuddyPress is for front sided social networks with lots of features. Status App is for the content creators of a site. If you have ever used Yammer then you can understand the need for this type of functionality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For now, @modemlooper is completing more user testing on multiple devices before the beta release of the plugin. More features are currently in the works, including @mentions, favoriting, profile editing, private messages. He plans to release Status App as a free plugin with a commercial version available to include more settings and add additional features. </p>\n<p>Check out @modemlooper&#8217;s <a href="http://taptappress.com/news/" target="_blank">TapTapPress blog</a> for more discussions on developing mobile apps for WordPress. If you&#8217;re testing the Status App and can help with reporting any issues, <a href="http://taptappress.com/contact/" target="_blank">get in touch with Ryan</a> and let him know the type of device you&#8217;re using.</p>\n<p>I tested Status App last night and found it to be ridiculously simple and enjoyable to use. Additionally, unlike using Twitter, you own your own data when you create your own messaging service. I believe it&#8217;s apps like these that will lead to the ultimate crumbling of the massive social data silos that feed you advertisements and blatantly disregard user privacy. Eventually, users are going to be fed up and will flock to simple private social networks like the kind you can create with Status App. We&#8217;ll be closely following the evolution of this app and will let you know when you can download the free plugin to create your own micro messaging service.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 20:43:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: 30 Beautiful Brewery Websites Built With WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=15321";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:164:"http://wptavern.com/30-beautiful-brewery-websites-built-with-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=30-beautiful-brewery-websites-built-with-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8099:"<p>While the WordPress community continues to grow and expand every day, so does the craft beer scene. So it only makes sense that a growing number of craft breweries are choosing to build their websites on WordPress. After all, WordPress and craft beer have a lot in common: enthusiasm, loyalty, broad appeal, no shortage of strong opinions and a community of contributors of every stripe. </p>\n<p>Craft brewers often share many of the same ideals found in open source culture, including  the cheerful sharing of knowledge, skills, recipes and the strong support of each other&#8217;s work. You might even say that craft brewing culture is the open source version of the beer industry. With that in mind, here are 30 beautiful brewery websites that have been built with WordPress. Pour your favorite local pint, sit back, and enjoy.

href="http://presscastle.com/" target="_blank">PressCastle</a> launched this month with an ambitious goal: to put every WordPress theme in one place. The site currently has more than 13,000 themes that are categorized and searchable. The themes were collected from more than 250 sites and represent 400+ theme authors.</p>\n<p>If you visit the <a href="http://presscastle.com/themes/" target="_blank">Themes section</a> of the site you can filter themes based on price, layout, framework and genre with subcategories for each. PressCastle is in the process of adding filters to the themes to specify compatibility with multisite, BuddyPress, bbPress, Jigoshop and other commonly used plugins.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/presscastle-themes.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15264]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/presscastle-themes.jpg" alt="presscastle-themes" width="946" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15298" /></a></p>\n<p>The site is using affiliate links on the themes to help fund the efforts required for indexing this massive library. The launch post claims that they now have the largest and most up to date index of WordPress themes on the web. They plan to update it with new theme releases and remove discontinued items along the way.</p>\n<p>I entered a few common search terms related to WordPress themes and found that the search engine was quite accurate in returning relevant information. Although, from a consumer standpoint, I have a difficult time connecting with the whole medieval castle theme they&#8217;ve got running, I can see the utility in the indexing and searching capabilities PressCastle provides. But does it solve a real problem?</p>\n<h3>Are WordPress Theme Indexing Sites a Fad?</h3>\n<p>The fact that themes are scattered throughout hundreds of websites can make it difficult to locate one that you want to use. PressCastle is trying to provide a solution for this. <a href="http://wptavern.com/theme-friendly-helps-you-find-the-perfect-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">Theme Friendly</a> is another site that recently launched with a similar goal of helping users find the perfect WordPress theme. While Theme Friendly has a different angle in that it provides reviews on the quality of themes, the work is similarly powered by affiliate links. Only time will tell whether affiliate commissions will be adequate compensation for the amount of effort required to keep these indexes current.</p>\n<p>Theme indexing sites seem to be popping up quite frequently these days, all of them vying to capitalize on the high demand for WordPress themes and the difficulty users have when searching. The question remains &#8211; will any of these sites actually take off and gain a following? In many cases their efforts seem to be duplicating the results a user might find with a reasonably formed search engine query. So I put the question to you: <strong>Are you likely to visit a WordPress theme indexing site when shopping for your next theme?</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 00:09:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Alex King: Owning Your Online Identity";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=19292";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/01/own-your-online-identity/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1470:"<div>\n	<img width="160" height="120" src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-23-at-2.39.30-PM-160x120.png" class="attachment-thumb-img wp-post-image" alt="Post at the Crowd Favorite blog" /></div>\n<p>I&#8217;ve put up a post on the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/">Crowd Favorite blog</a> about how I use WordPress and the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/favepersonal/">FavePersonal</a> theme (free!) to own my online identity, while still participating with my friends on Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<p>I love how I have (on my own site) a history of the social reactions to <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2013/04/24/capsule-the-developers-code-journal">posts like this</a>.

Automatic background updates will be gradually rolled out over the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p>One of the most notable fixes was switching Twitter oEmbed to SSL. Twitter changed its API, which broke Twitter oEmbed links across all WordPress installations. If you&#8217;ve got a lot of content with embedded tweets, then upgrading to WordPress 3.8.1 should be a high priority for you. </p>\n<p>Additionally, WordPress 3.8.1 addresses some issues with taxonomy queries in WP_Query, general fixes for the newly designed admin areas and resolves a strange bug with &#8220;dead zones&#8221; on submit buttons.</p>\n<h3>An Impressive Success Rate For Automatic Updates</h3>\n<p>Skeptics of WordPress 3.7&#8242;s automatic updates feature may be interested in looking at the results so far. The success rate for automatic updates with WordPress 3.8 was astonishing, given that it was a major release, with many major changes. Andrew Nacin <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/18/automatic-updates-for-3-8-started-to-flow-early/" target="_blank">cites</a> the stats for critical failures:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Success rate is around 99.78 percent of about 15,000 updates. That’s a bit lower than 3.7.1, which was 99.988 percent for about a million updates. This is to be expected; for example, far more files were changed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When referring to critical failures, Nacin clarifies that these are not disaster scenarios, as the term might seem to indicate. &#8220;<strong>Remember that a critical failure (what these numbers are calculating) only means &#8216;we started to copy files and failed to verify we copied all of them&#8217;</strong>,&#8221; he clarified. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean the site crashed and burned.&#8221; </p>\n<p>These stats are good news for any WordPress admin who has been hesitant to have automatic background updates turned on for minor releases. If you previously had background updates turned off, now might be a good time to consider <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-configure-automatic-core-updates-for-wordpress-3-7" target="_blank">re-configuring your settings</a> to include automatic core updates for minor releases. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 21:24:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.8.1 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=3063";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2014/01/wordpress-3-8-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3834:"<p>After six weeks and more than <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/counter/">9.3 million downloads</a> of WordPress 3.8, we&#8217;re pleased to announce WordPress 3.8.1 is now available.</p>\n<p>Version 3.8.1 is a maintenance releases that addresses 31 bugs in 3.8, including various fixes and improvements for the new dashboard design and new themes admin screen.

Epstein is part of a team of folks, including Scott Reilly, Pippin Williamson, Otto, and a handful of others, who stand at the door of the repository and review incoming plugins to make sure they meet the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/" target="_blank">guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>How does someone get involved with reviewing plugins for WordPress? For Mika it was in the vein with something she&#8217;d be doing already. She has a passion for helping plugins play nice with WordPress. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Otto reached out to me to join the plugin review team after I started, on my own, scanning the repo using <a href="https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Plugin-Directory-Slurper" target="_blank">Mark Jaquith&#8217;s slurper</a> &#8211; for people who were doing some silly, but easy to mistake, things like jquery. This started after WP upgraded jquery and a lot of plugins and themes broke. I was so annoyed, I started trying to head them off at the pass.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>The Plugin Review Process</h3>\n<p>Once a plugin developer submits his work to the directory, he or she generally has to wait a little while for it to be approved. Epstein says that they try to get to everyone within seven days but that some weeks are better than others. &#8220;Small plugins are often approved right away, larger can take a while,&#8221; she said. &#8220;On our good days, we can same-day review everyone. How long each review takes is also subjective to the plugin size and complexity. <span class="pullquote alignleft">Many times a delay pops up when we have to figure out what the code was supposed to do because of poor documentation.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a helpful gem in there for aspiring plugin developers submitting to WordPress.org: <strong>The better your documentation is, the faster your plugin is likely to move through the process.</strong></p>\n<p>You might be surprised to learn that the plugin review process is not terribly mysterious or complicated. It simply takes a little bit of time. Epstein outlines what&#8217;s involved:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We review plugin submissions, and that really means we download the zip, read the code, test it, and approve it or push back for various things. Every single line of code is looked at, and we generally look for things that are &#8216;wrong.&#8217; After a while, they start to jump out at you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This translates into a daily routine for her. <strong>&#8220;I usually spend an hour or two a day just on plugins,&#8221;</strong> Epstein said. &#8220;Minimum&#8217;s an hour, which lets me run a decent triage on people with pending requests and some of the new ones.&#8221; Additionally, there are reports and weird issues that come in that she will funnel to the entire team.</p>\n<h4>The Most Common Issues With Plugins</h4>\n<p>Believe it or not, the most common reason for a plugin to get rejected is not ultimately due to brazen violations of the guidelines. Epstein says that many plugin authors simply do not reply to emails: &#8220;After 7 days, if the plugin code isn&#8217;t completed, the plugin&#8217;s rejected.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Bad plugin names are another reason that she says are grounds for rejection, as well as HTML in the title. &#8220;We auto-reject anyone with &#8216;wordpress&#8217; in the plugin slug (like you can no longer request &#8216;wordpress-fedex-shipping&#8217;) but manually we reject anything with encoded HTML characters in the title (like %d) or the term &#8216;plugin&#8217; (most of the time&#8230; if your plugin is &#8216;network plugin settings&#8217; that&#8217;s okay, but &#8216;rebooter-plugin&#8217; is not).&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Why Plugins Get Pulled From the Directory</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen it happen a time or two: A plugin is newly listed in the repository and then it suddenly vanishes a day or two later. I asked Mika why it is that a plugins make it through this review process but end up being pulled just a couple days later. She replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ouch. So &#8230; we&#8217;re human, right? And SOME plugins are really simple and others are really complex. Just like the dev may miss a security hole in their plugin, we might too. While we do look at every line of code, the problem with this is the same as the problem with all security reviews and that is we look for wrong, and sometimes miss it in the cruft of right.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, Epstein said that sometimes WP Tavern or another site will post about a new plugin and then a larger number of people will take a look at it, inspect the code, and uncover something that might have been missed. However, there are some plugin developers out there with bad motives, who knowingly violate the guidelines through what Epstein calls a <strong>&#8220;bait-and-switch&#8221;</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Someone submits plugin A, we approve it, but they upload plugin B to the repository. That&#8217;s something a lot of spammers like to do. Sometimes people upload the wrong version of the code by accident, other times they intentionally go back and add in code we told them to remove. We try to mitigate this by filtering emails (I actually get an email for every single plugin check in) and scan for known issues, but it&#8217;s never-ending. Right now there are 20 security reports to go through.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The review team is constantly improving its checks, which help them scan for the most basic and unintentional violations. Unfortuantely, there is no way to scan for bait-and-switch techniques, which require someone to go back and manually check for violations after the plugin is already sent to the repository.</p>\n<h3>Advice For Managing Orphaned Plugins</h3>\n<p>One of the problems plaguing the plugin directory is plugins that have been abandoned or are no longer maintained. Given Epstein&#8217;s close involvement with support, I asked her what the best course of action is for a plugin author who no longer wishes to update his/her plugin on WordPress.org. Would it be best to remove it? If he/she can&#8217;t find someone to adopt the plugin, is it better to leave the plugin there as a starting point for someone else or to remove it entirely to prevent frustrating users? Ultimately, the decision falls to the plugin author, but Epstein offered some practical tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a plugin author wants to no longer support or update a plugin, I suggest they make DARN SURE that&#8217;s documented in their readme!</li>\n<li>If they want to leave it open for someone else to adopt that&#8217;s great, just make sure to put up a way to be contacted.</li>\n<li>If they want to close it forever and ever, that&#8217;s okay too, just email plugins AT wordpress.org and link to the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Which is better? Depends on the plugin,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Like <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/twitter-blackbird-pie/" target="_blank">Blackbird Pie</a>, the plugin to embed Twitter, was something I would feel was essential not to close &#8230; until we added in Twitter oEmbeds. Now it&#8217;s not really as needed and may not even work. Would I extend that or close it? Hard to say, even if it was mine.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Readme.txt File is Key to Improving User Experience in the Plugin Directory</h3>\n<p>When searching the directory, it&#8217;s not uncommon to find plugins with what seems to be only a title. Many plugins are missing vital details (or any details), screenshots, FAQs and basic information about what the plugin does. I asked Epstein what can we do to encourage plugin authors to provide more information. She has a few solid tips:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I hate bad readmes with a passion. I try to push people to make better ones, pointing out that if the readme (which makes your wporg repository page) isn&#8217;t descriptive and helpful, no one will use your plugin and you&#8217;ll waste time answering easy questions. But we only force them to have a readme at submission if they&#8217;re a service (that is they&#8217;re calling other servers). Screenshots aren&#8217;t always needed, but a good and descriptive readme would save everyone a lot of pain. Short of letting me actually chase after people with a baseball bat, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll ever get to a place where everyone&#8217;s doing that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, the plugin review team cannot require better readme.txt files, but her advice would be good to take to heart if you are a plugin developer reading this. Don&#8217;t leave people in the dark about what your plugin does if you want anyone to use it.</p>\n<p>Now that you know a little bit more about what the plugin review team has to contend with, aren&#8217;t you grateful for everything they do on WordPress.org? Many thanks to Mika Epstein and the rest of the team for their daily work on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">WordPress Plugin Directory</a>. Without them, the directory would be a wasteland, overrun with spam and security threats. Because of their dedication, WordPress.org remains one of the safest places to look for extensions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 20:31:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"WPTavern: Tickets On Sale For WordCamp Dayton, Ohio";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=15246";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:144:"http://wptavern.com/tickets-on-sale-for-wordcamp-dayton-ohio?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tickets-on-sale-for-wordcamp-dayton-ohio";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1975:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WordCampDayton2014Logo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15246]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WordCampDayton2014Logo.jpg" alt="WordCamp Dayton 2014" width="177" height="226" class="alignright size-full wp-image-12640" /></a> Six weeks from now between March 7th and 8th, <a href="http://2014.dayton.wordcamp.org/" title="http://2014.dayton.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Dayton, Ohio</a> will be underway.

It’s a creative gale of destruction that irreversibly changes every industry it touches, and if you don&#8217;t control the software, the software controls you. It mediates how and with whom you communicate, what news you see, and what other software you&#8217;re able to run. It <a title="Long, but good, read." href="http://edge.org/responses/how-is-the-internet-changing-the-way-you-think">influences</a> the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">very way your brain works</a>, as you process the creative gale of <em>distraction</em> that interrupts us all hundreds of times each day. With <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/10/escape.html">every ping</a>, software burrows deeper into our lives.</p>\n<p>In the early nineties, a prescient hacker named <a title="Read about the parrots." href="http://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> — working at MIT, where today&#8217;s future had already happened — recognized this shift. He <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">proposed a set of four freedoms</a> that were fundamental for software in an enlightened, tech-dependent society.</p>\n<ol start="0">\n<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>\n<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</li>\n<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>\n<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Aside: I originally thought Stallman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering">started counting with zero instead of one</a> because he&#8217;s a geek. He is, but that wasn&#8217;t the reason. Freedoms one, two, and three came first, but later he wanted to add something to supercede all of them. So: freedom zero. The geekness is a happy accident.)</p>\n<p>This is our Bill of Rights. Stallman called it <a title="Don''t call it open source." href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>. The &#8220;free&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have to do with price, as you’re still free to charge for your software, but with freedom to create. Or as we geeks often say: not free as in beer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States">free as in speech</a>.</p>\n<p>People are scared of free software, and I understand why. You&#8217;re taking the <a title="Industries with low IP protection are more creative and generate more sales." href="http://intenseminimalism.com/2010/creativity-in-a-copyright-less-world/">most valuable thing</a> you have, <a title="Old-school theme." href="http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=1519">your intellectual property</a>, and granting the freedom you enjoy as a creator to anyone who downloads your work. It&#8217;s terrifying, actually. It’s releasing your ideas, and letting anyone build on them — in a way that might be better than your own work. It’s releasing your traditional understanding of ownership, and your fear of being out-developed.</p>\n<p>The most experienced entrepreneurs can cling to the concept that your <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html">idea is something precious that must be protected from the world</a>, and meted out in a controlled way. Lots of us hang on to the assumption that scarcity creates a proprietary advantage. It’s how many non-tech markets work.</p>\n<p>Open source abdicates your flexibility as a developer to better serve the people who actually use your products. You can see that as a constraint&#8230; or you can see it as a door to iteration, innovation, and constant progress.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent a third of my life building software based on Stallman’s four freedoms, and I&#8217;ve been astonished by the results. <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for those freedoms, and it couldn’t have evolved the way it has.</p>\n<p>WordPress was based on a program called <a title="The header is still classic." href="http://cafelog.com/">B2/cafelog</a> that predated it by two years. I was using B2 because it had freedoms 0 and 1: I could use it for whatever I wanted, including my zero-budget personal blog, and the source code was open. It was elegant and easy to understand, and anyone could tweak it.</p>\n<p>B2 was ultimately <a title="This post is where WordPress started." href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">abandoned</a> by its creator. If I’d been using it under a proprietary license, that would have been the end — for me, and all its other users. But because we had freedoms 2 and 3, Mike Little and I were able to use the software as a foundation, giving us a two-year headstart over building something from scratch, and realize our own vision of what blogging could be.</p>\n<p>We were just consumers of the software, volunteers in the forums, and occasional contributors to the codebase, but because (of the GPL) we had the freedom to build on B2, we were able to continue development as if it had been our own creation.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, those freedoms are still embedded in every copy of WordPress downloaded, including the <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/counter/">9.2 million downloaded</a> in the past month or so since our <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/">3.8 release</a>.</p>\n<p>I believe that software, and in fact entire companies, should be run in a way that assumes that the sum of the talent of people outside your walls is greater than the sum of the few you have inside. None of us are as smart as all of us. Given the right environment — one that leverages the marginal cost of distributing software and ideas — independent actors can work toward something that benefits them, while also increasing the capability of the entire community.</p>\n<p>This is where open source gets really interesting: it&#8217;s not just about the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">legal wonkery around software licensing</a>, but what effect open sourced software has on people using it. In the proprietary world, those people are typically called &#8220;users,&#8221; a strange term that connotes dependence and addiction. In the open source world, they’re more rightly called a community.</p>\n<p>The core features of WordPress aren’t <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Do-It-Yourself/dp/0321657292">rocket surgery</a>. A handful of smart people in a room for a year could create a reasonable approximation of the software, and undoubtably improve some things — I see other startups do this <a title="Someday they will build a museum to document your former competitors." href="http://www.crunchbase.com/tag/cms">three or four times a year</a>.</p>\n<p>What they miss is that WordPress isn&#8217;t a checklist of features. It&#8217;s over <a title="I have about 20 of them." href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/">29,000 plugins</a> created by the community, from the in-demand things like SEO to niche features like <a title="I can''t make these things up." href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hundstall-404/">using your 404 page to help adopt homeless dogs in Sweden</a>. Every WordPress site looks different, because of the thousands of themes available. Instead of one event to outdo, there are more than <a title="Check one out if you haven''t been yet, amazing groups of folks." href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">70 volunteer-organized WordCamps on six continents</a> (and there’ll be more in 2014).</p>\n<p>WordPress marketing has nothing to do with its website or <a title="Fight the Fauxgo." href="http://wordpress.org/about/logos/">logo</a>, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/">tens of thousands of people who make a living building WordPress sites</a> and receive so much value from it that they proselytize to anyone that will listen, spreading the flame one site at a time. It works — as of December 2013, 21% of websites are powered by WordPress. One-fifth of the web is built with a tool that anyone can use, change, or improve, whenever and however they want (even more when you count other open source projects, like Drupal).</p>\n<p>This approach to building isn&#8217;t an abdication of developers’ and designers’ responsibility to build beautiful, functional software. Design and forethought are <em>more important</em> than ever when every change sends millions of independent actors down a new path. Changes to WordPress have consequences today, tomorrow, five years, and ten years down the road, but the passion and talent of the community helps ensure that it always moves forward in a positive way.</p>\n<p>The four freedoms don’t limit us as creators — they open possibilities for us as creators <em>and</em> consumers. When you apply them to software, you get Linux, Webkit/Chrome, and WordPress. When you apply them to medicine, you get the <a href="http://www.opengenomicsengine.org/">Open Genomics Engine</a>, which is accelerating cancer research and bringing us closer to personalized treatment. When you apply them to companies, you get radically geographically distributed, results-based organizations like <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>. When you apply them to events you get <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx">TEDx</a>, <a title="Which I accidentally ended up helping get started." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">Barcamp</a>, and <a href="http://wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>. When you apply them to knowledge, you get <a title="Where people argue you for deletion." href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/">William Gibson</a> is attributed with saying &#8220;The future is already here — it&#8217;s just not very evenly distributed.&#8221; The world is changing faster than any one person or organization can keep up with it. Closed off, proprietary development creates closed off, proprietary products that won’t keep pace in the long run. Open source provides another path — one that’s open to everyone, and can take advantage of the skills and talents of anyone in the world to build software that helps everyone.</p>\n<p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy''s_Law_(management)">Bill Joy said</a>, &#8220;No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.&#8221; Good ideas aren’t the sole province of groups of people behind high walls, and software shouldn’t be either.</p>\n<p><em>This was adapted from a talk I gave at <a title="Was great fun, hope they do it again next year." href="http://www.lifeisbeautifulfestival.com/">the Life is Beautiful festival</a> in <a title="One of the more interesting scenes around right now." href="http://downtownproject.com/">Downtown Las Vegas</a>.

last time I spoke with <a href="http://jason.sc/" title="http://jason.sc/">Jason Schuller</a>, it was 2008 at WordCamp Chicago. He had just launched his commercial theme company <a href="http://press75.com/" title="http://press75.com/">Press75</a>. Since 2008, he&#8217;s launched a number of projects such as ThemeGarden, the first ever WordPress theme marketplace that gave 100% of the sale back to the theme author. Lately, Jason has been experimenting with creating simple publishing systems like Dropplets and Leeflets that focus on streamlining the publishing process. Many of these projects have since shut down.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ThemeGardenLogo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15204]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ThemeGardenLogo.jpg" alt="ThemeGarden Logo" width="458" height="231" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15222" /></a></p>\n<p>I caught up with Jason Schuller one on one to find out what happened to all of the projects mentioned above, what he&#8217;s been up to the past 6 years and last but not least, find out what he&#8217;s working on in the immediate future. During the interview, we learn some valuable lessons from Jason such as when to ask others for help when a project gets too large for one person to handle. He tells us how he got involved with WordPress theme development and how WordPress became a pivotal moment in his life. </p>\n<p>One of the main reasons for conducting this interview is that based on everything I&#8217;ve read from <a href="https://twitter.com/jschuller" title="https://twitter.com/jschuller">his Twitter account</a>, it seemed like he was leaving the WordPress community to pursue other opportunities. Jason told me that although he won&#8217;t be concentrating his efforts on WordPress in the immediate future, he will still attend WordCamps and continue to interact with all of the friends he&#8217;s made throughout the community over the years. I wish Jason the best with his future endeavors and hope you enjoy the interview. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:05:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: WordPress.org vs. GitHub For Hosting WordPress Plugins and Themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=13576";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:192:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-vs-github-for-hosting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-org-vs-github-for-hosting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8157:"<p>There are many factors that come into play when deciding where to host your open source WordPress plugin or theme. Who is your target audience? How much support do you want to offer? Is the project open for collaboration? For many developers this choice often comes down to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> vs. <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. </p>\n<p>In the past, hosting with WordPress.org was the only option that would allow developers to push out updates to their plugin or theme via the WordPress admin. The <a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater" target="_blank">GitHub Updater</a> plugin, created by Andy Fragen and added to GitHub in July of 2013, makes it possible to ship updates to Github-hosted plugins and themes. This makes it convenient for developers who prefer GitHub to stay within their preferred workflow while continuing to provide updates. Incidentally, this plugin is banned from the WordPress.org repository.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/updater.png" rel="prettyphoto[13576]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/updater.png" alt="updater" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15182" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course there are a number of other places that you can host your project, i.e. your own website or another code sharing site. We&#8217;re looking at GitHub vs. WordPress.org for the purposes of this comparison, since the two are among the most popular.</p>\n<h2>Advantages of Hosting Your Project on WordPress.org</h2>\n<p>By far, one of the best reasons to host a plugin or theme on WordPress.org is the increased exposure that it will offer for your work. Your extension is just a couple clicks away when a user performs a search within the WordPress admin, giving you an audience of millions of potential users. </p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wporg.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13576]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wporg.jpg" alt="wporg" width="969" height="399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15207" /></a></p>\n<p>A summary of the advantages includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum exposure: Your extension can be searched for within the WP admin</li>\n<li>Built-in trac and support forums</li>\n<li>Easily push out updates to users</li>\n<li>Ratings, reviews and download stats</li>\n<li>Extensions are more trusted due to the WordPress.org review process and guidelines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, some of these same &#8220;advantages&#8221; could also be considered disadvantages. For example, if you&#8217;re not willing to offer free support, having your plugin or theme on WordPress.org with such a wide audience may send you a flood of support requests. If you don&#8217;t have the time to provide updates or support, the resulting star ratings and reviews may hurt your extension&#8217;s reputation.</p>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<p>One of the primary disadvantages of hosting a project on WordPress.org alone is that it can severely limit collaboration. Themes and plugins on WordPress.org are simply not geared for collaborative development. Most developers find it easier to collaborate via Git. Hosting on WordPress.org also requires a basic knowledge of SVN, which is not very popular these days. In summary, the disadvantages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SVN</li>\n<li>Does not encourage collaboration</li>\n<li>Possible massive influx of support requests</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Advantages of Hosting Your Project on GitHub</h2>\n<p>Where a lack of collaboration is probably the strongest disadvantage of hosting on WordPress.org, it&#8217;s also the biggest advantage to hosting your extension on GitHub. The barrier of entry for participation on GitHub is much higher, which significantly lessens the likelihood of you becoming inundated with support requests.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/github-social-coding.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13576]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/github-social-coding.jpg" alt="github-social-coding" width="580" height="230" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15213" /></a></p>\n<p>Other advantages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy for others to contribute to your project</li>\n<li>Built-in wiki and issues queue available</li>\n<li>Fewer support requests</li>\n<li>Can easily push out updates w/ use of GitHub Updater</li>\n<li>Fewer restrictions &#8211; No code review process or extra guidelines for compliance</li>\n<li>Traffic analytics &#8211; GitHub recently introduced <a href="https://github.com/blog/1672-introducing-github-traffic-analytics" target="_blank">analytics data</a> for repositories</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Likely a smaller audience</li>\n<li>Will need to bundle the Git Updater with your extension or ask users to install it in order to ship updates</li>\n<li>Does not include the same level of user trust as projects hosed on WordPress.org</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to have to mess with SVN and don&#8217;t mind losing out on the audience you get hosting on WordPress.org, then hosting your project on GitHub might be a strong option for you. </p>\n<h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpvsgithub.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13576]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpvsgithub.jpg" alt="wpvsgithub" width="1600" height="594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15216" /></a><br />\nThere&#8217;s no clear winner in the comparison between hosting on WordPress.org vs. Github. It depends entirely on your workflow and your goals for the extension.  Of course, many projects do a mixture of both, either through maintaining git mirrors or synchronizing via a script. Since every GitHub repository is also a Subversion repository, you can use SVN tools to checkout, branch, and commit to GitHub repositories if you are so inclined.  </p>\n<p>Brent Shepherd has a <a href="https://github.com/thenbrent/multisite-user-management/blob/master/deploy.sh" target="_blank">script that will deploy a WordPress plugin from within Git</a> to WordPress.org&#8217;s SVN repository. &#8220;Since running the script for my plugins, I&#8217;ve not suffered the frustrations of minor errors – like having version numbers in the readme.txt &#038; plugin file differ,&#8221; Shepherd said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost less time deploying, so I&#8217;ve released more frequently, which means fewer bugs in the wild.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here are some other resources you might want to check out for learning more about working between Git and SVN for WordPress extensions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://ben.lobaugh.net/blog/90633/creating-a-synchronized-github-fork-of-a-wordpress-org-subversion-plugin-repository" target="_blank">Creating a Synchronized Github Fork of a WordPress.org Subversion Plugin Repository</a> &#8211; Ben Lobaugh</li>\n<li><a href="http://teleogistic.net/2011/05/revisiting-git-github-and-the-wordpress-org-plugin-repository/" target="_blank">Revisiting Git, Github, and the WordPress.org Plugin Repository</a> &#8211; Boone Gorges</li>\n<li><a href="http://danielbachhuber.com/2012/09/30/git-in-my-subversion/" target="_blank">Git in my Subversion</a> &#8211; Daniel Bachhuber</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/growthdesigner/WordPress-3.8-Dashboard/issues/3" target="_blank">Syncing Git Repo with WordPress.org</a> &#8211; Daniel Bachhuber</li>\n<li><a href="http://thereforei.am/2011/04/21/git-to-svn-automated-wordpress-plugin-deployment/" target="_blank">Git to SVN: Automated WordPress Plugin Deployment</a> &#8211; Brent Shepherd</li>\n<li><a href="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/developing-wordpress-plugins-in-github" target="_blank">Developing WordPress Plugins in Github</a> &#8211; Sudar Muthu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every developer has a different workflow, but there&#8217;s a good option for however you choose to develop and maintain your WordPress plugin or theme.

SiteGround CEO, Tenko Nikolov, answered questions that provide insight into how the company operates on a day to day basis. I was surprised to learn that the company is just a few months younger than WordPress and will be celebrating their 10th anniversary in March. Check out these numbers that represent an average day of customer support:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The story behind SiteGround is actually pretty cool, it was founded in 2004 by a group of university friends, with a handful of people working from their uni dorm rooms and has grown to the point where today it has 120 employees and is still growing. SiteGround claims to host over 250,000 domains and process 400 tickets, 150 phone calls and 300 chat requests per day.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Customer Service Used As A Foundation</h3>\n<p>When the company started, Tenko mentions the company’s vision was to provide more help to the customers than a standard host did at that time. This is interesting to me because ten years later, WordPress centric hosting companies are being started with the same vision. <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-118-hey-get-flywheel" title="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-118-hey-get-flywheel">Flywheel hosting</a> is the most recent example of a host that puts customer service at the forefront of everything they do. At this point, what else is there to differentiate webhosting companies from one another besides customer service? </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been vocal about the problems I&#8217;ve experienced with webhosting companies <a href="http://wptavern.com/my-performance-woes" title="http://wptavern.com/my-performance-woes">such as HostGator</a>. As I said in a <a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/webhostingwarriors" title="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/webhostingwarriors">recent interview with Web Hosting Warriors</a>, how a webhosting company treats you when a major problem surfaces tells you everything you need to know. </p>\n<h3>My Thoughts On Webhosting Companies</h3>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll tune in and listen as I share my experiences with webhosting companies I&#8217;ve used in the past to host WPTavern.com. I also explain what I as a customer expect out of the company, especially from the customer service stand point. While I initially talk about the history of WPTavern and how I turned it into a successful website, you can fast forward to the <strong>13 minute mark</strong> to hear me discuss my woes with HostGator. </p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<h3>What Do You Look For In a Webhost</h3>\n<p>In 2010, I shared my list of <a href="http://wptavern.com/14-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-webhost-for-your-wordpress-powered-site" title="http://wptavern.com/14-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-webhost-for-your-wordpress-powered-site">fourteen things to consider</a> before choosing a webhost. Many of the things I listed in that post are still relevant today. Having a great experience with a webhosting company is almost like winning the lottery because it’s so rare. Ultimately, it comes down to gathering as much information as possible in order to make an informed decision as to whether a particular webhost is right for you. Price should not be the only determining factor for hosting your site, especially if you plan on taking things seriously. What is the most important factor you look for in a webhost? What influences your decision to go with one particular company over another? </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 23:23:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: tinyCoffee: A Simple, Elegant Donation Plugin for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=14948";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:178:"http://wptavern.com/tinycoffee-a-simple-elegant-donation-plugin-for-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tinycoffee-a-simple-elegant-donation-plugin-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3567:"<p>The WordPress plugin repository hosts dozens of extensions for accepting donations and includes everything from plugins for creating donation forms to plugins that implement full-on CRM solutions for non-profits.

It gives visitors an opportunity to support your work by sending you a beverage of your choice. tinyCoffee features an interactive slider that automatically calculates how many beverages the donation will buy.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sample-donation-page.png" rel="prettyphoto[14948]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sample-donation-page.png" alt="sample-donation-page" width="804" height="463" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15111" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin makes use of the <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">FontAwesome</a> icon font collection to render the beverage image. the tinyCoffee options panel lets you select the icon you&#8217;d like to use, so you&#8217;re not limited to just coffee or beer, or even beverages for that matter. You can select music, money, film, books or anything that fits in with your interests.</p>\n<p>tinyCoffee also makes it easy to place your donation request anywhere within your website with the following four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Template tag (get_coffee()/the_coffee())</li>\n<li>Shortcode ([tiny_coffee]/[tiny_coffee])</li>\n<li>Sidebar widget</li>\n<li>Hash-activated modal screen (domain.com#coffee)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for example, if you wanted to make &#8220;Coffee&#8221; a permanent menu item that launches a modal window or link to it within your content, you would simply add the hash to your link:</p>\n<pre>http://example.com#coffee</pre>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/donation-modal.png" rel="prettyphoto[14948]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/donation-modal.png" alt="donation-modal" width="1260" height="389" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15112" /></a></p>\n<p>I tested the modal window on mobile to make sure it was device-friendly and it launched just as smoothly as it would on desktop. I also put the plugin through the paces to see how each placement option worked and was pleasantly surprised to find that the options panel offered far more customization options than detailed in its readme.txt file. You can easily change just about everything related to its display, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title and default text outputted by the plugin</li>\n<li>Select the FontAwesome icon</li>\n<li>Customize the hash</li>\n<li>Change the currency template</li>\n<li>Set the coffee price</li>\n<li>PayPal details, currency, exchange rate</li>\n<li>Customize Callback URL settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When it comes to donation plugins, tinyCoffee has most others beat on simplicity, design and configuration options. If you work on an open source project or offer something for free on your website, the last thing you want to spend your time on is testing a bunch of donation plugins. If it isn&#8217;t convenient, you&#8217;re likely to skip it altogether.

Front-end editing capabilities are being developed as a <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/" target="_blank">feature plugin</a> and will hopefully be considered for inclusion in the core sometime this year. It currently looks a little something like this:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frontend-editing.png" rel="prettyphoto[15070]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frontend-editing.png" alt="frontend-editing" width="1280" height="699" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15075" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin has improved by leaps and bounds since the last time I took it for a test drive. I&#8217;ve got it active on a site where I try everything that is fun. Despite the fact that it&#8217;s still under heavy development, the plugin is actually quite enjoyable to use. Editing posts on the frontend is lightening fast. </p>\n<h3>New Modal Added For Post Meta Boxes</h3>\n<p>The most recent update includes the ability to create posts and pages from the frontend. Janneke Van Dorpe, the project lead, has also added more TinyMCE tools and a new modal window to display post meta boxes. This works in a similar way to the media modal.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/custom-fields.png" rel="prettyphoto[15070]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/custom-fields.png" alt="custom-fields" width="1280" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15079" /></a></p>\n<h3>New Media Features: oEmbed, Gallery Previews and Featured Image Editing</h3>\n<p>Just after Christmas the team <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/12/26/front-end-editor-quick-christmas-update/" target="_blank">posted</a> some exciting media updates to the plugin. The WordPress Front-end Editor now automatically embeds links supported by oEmbed. It can also generate a preview of galleries and captions and allows for adding, editing or removing featured images. This video is a quick demonstration of those features in action:</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>Since front-end editing is being developed as a feature plugin, you can test it out early if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous. Feel free to use it during its experimental stage and monitor the progress. You can find the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/" target="_blank">WordPress Front-end Editor</a> plugin in the WordPress plugin repository.

Created by WordPress theme developer Fikri Rasyid, Opus takes a mobile first approach to responsive design and features a fluid layout. When he set out to create Opus, Rasyid wanted the theme to provide a great reading experience on any device. He also wanted it to have personality.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://designmodo.com/square-free/" target="_blank">Square UI Design Kit</a>, Rasyid created Opus to incorporate a similar flat design with big fonts and spacious elements. Opus makes use of the popular <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans" target="_blank">Open Sans</a> font.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/opus.png" rel="prettyphoto[15039]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/opus.png" alt="opus" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15041" /></a></p>\n<h3>A Post Editor to Match the Frontend</h3>\n<p>One unique feature of the theme is that the developer has added styles to make the post editing experience match the frontend as much as possible when the visual editor is in use.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[15039]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post-editor.png" alt="post-editor" width="520" height="365" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15045" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Personality Factor</h3>\n<p>The main visual feature of this theme is the big header image on the homepage, which is intended for users to customize. Opus includes support for WordPress&#8217; native custom header and you can easily change the theme&#8217;s colors via the customizer as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/customizer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15039]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/customizer.jpg" alt="customizer" width="1046" height="512" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15051" /></a></p>\n<p>Check out a <a href="http://fikrirasyid.com/wordpress-themes/opus/" target="_blank">demo</a> on the developer&#8217;s website to see Opus in action.</p>\n<p>If you like the theme and want to contribute, <a href="https://github.com/fikrirasyid/opus" target="_blank">Opus is also hosted on github</a> and its developer welcomes you to fork it, submit a patch, pull request or report any bugs you find.

If you’ve developed this kind of plugin, please see the 3.x to 4.0 <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x">migration guide</a> and the <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/api4:index">4.0 API documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress plugins that add third-party or default TinyMCE plugins would (of course) need to be updated to include the 4.0 version of the plugin. The PHP global $tinymce_version can be used to determine which plugin to load.</li>\n<li>Mini-plugins that only add a button to the toolbar. This works pretty much the same. It is advisable to update to use the ‘dashicons’ icon font instead of image icon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TinyMCE40Icons.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15016]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-15026" alt="TinyMCE 4.0 Icons" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TinyMCE40Icons.jpg" width="315" height="136" /></a>After upgrading to the bleeding edge version of WordPress 3.9 to compare the visual editor with WordPress 3.8, I immediately noticed that the <a title="http://ran.ge/wordpress-plugin/pull-quotes/" href="http://ran.ge/wordpress-plugin/pull-quotes/">Pull Quotes</a> icon image that&#8217;s added to the visual editor disappeared. While the place holder is still there and the button functions normally, the icon image is gone. There are two other plugins that have added custom icon images to the visual editor and those work just fine. However, since they are not using SVG images or Dashicons, the experience is not consistent with the rest of the interface.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re the author of a plugin that modifies or changes the behavior of TinyMCE, now is the time to test it against the trunk of WordPress so users don&#8217;t encounter unexpected changes when they upgrade to WordPress 3.9.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 21:00:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: WordCamp Paris 2014: Uniting The French WordPress Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=14988";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:180:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-paris-2014-uniting-the-french-wordpress-community?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-paris-2014-uniting-the-french-wordpress-community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5823:"<p>The third official <a href="http://2014.paris.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Paris</a> was held this past weekend, featuring 15 talks and seven workshops during Jan 17-18. From all accounts it seems to have been a stellar event. The first day focused on business and enterprise and the second day included a mix of talks and workshops focused on tech, design and community topics.</p>\n<p>All of the WordCamps that we&#8217;ve attended and reported on have been held in English, so I got in touch with <a href="http://www.jennybeaumont.com/" target="_blank">Jenny Beaumont</a> to see if she could give us an inside look into WordCamp Paris. </p>\n<div id="attachment_15019" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jennyb.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14988]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jennyb.jpg" alt="WordPress Developer Jenny Beaumont - photo credit: cc license -  Manuel Schmalstieg" width="610" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-15019" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress Developer Jenny Beaumont &#8211; photo credit: cc license &#8211;  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kinetoskop/12030822934/sizes/c/in/set-72157639932762833/">Manuel Schmalstieg</a></p></div>\n<p>Beaumont came to France in 1998 where she began her career in the web. She now lives in rural Normandy and works as a freelance front-end developer specializing in WordPress. </p>\n<p>While most of the sessions were given in French, a handful of presentations were in English. WordCamp Paris featured an impressive variety of topics, including challenges for WordPress agencies, pricing a WordPress site, multisite and multilingual case studies, e-commerce, interface design and much more. </p>\n<p>Beaumont attended 10 of the 23 conferences and workshops and said that two sessions were particularly outstanding. &#8220;There were a lot of interesting topics presented, including a round table debate about the world of theming,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But for me, two sessions really stood out above the rest: <a href="https://twitter.com/glueckpress" target="_blank">Caspar Hübinger</a>&#8216;s presentation &#8220;<a href="http://glueckpress.com/5175" target="_blank">The Multilingual Blogging Software Dilemma (and ways to solve it)</a>&#8220;, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BoiteAWeb" target="_blank">Julio Potier</a>&#8216;s &#8220;<a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/Boiteaweb/choisir-les-bons-hooks-dans-vos-dveloppements-wordpress" target="_blank">Diving into WordPress Hooks</a>&#8221; (rough translation). They were both tight, incredibly funny and very well delivered.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Workshops: An Alternative to Contributor Days</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Paris is unique in that the organizers have opted for facilitating workshops instead of hosting a contributor day. These are small sessions where Beaumont says everyone is encouraged to get into the nitty-gritty of subjects like hooks, multilingual publishing, SEO, the why and how of creating plugins and working with advanced custom fields. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re seeing what other WordCamps are, from what I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; Beaumont said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s a clear move from being technically oriented to really addressing all aspects — and all users — of the WordPress ecosystem.&#8221; The workshops at WordCamp Paris provided something for users of every level of WordPress expertise. </p>\n<h3>The French WordPress Community Is Growing</h3>\n<div id="attachment_15013" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wcparis.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14988]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wcparis.jpg" alt="photo credit: gd6d - cc license" width="1600" height="556" class="size-full wp-image-15013" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gd6d/12035168424/in/photostream/">gd6d</a> &#8211; cc license</p></div>\n<p>Beaumont attended the last two WordCamps held in Paris and she believes that the French WordPress community is growing in numbers and may expand to host another event outside of Paris.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although WordCamps have only been held in Paris to date, the French community is taking root in every region of France, and I shouldn&#8217;t neglect mentioning our French-speaking neighbors in Belgium and Switzerland who also had a presence. I predict a strong increase in the number of Meetups for 2014 and it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to see a WordCamp pop up outside of Paris in the near future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Every local WordPress community faces its own unique challenges. I asked Beaumont how she would characterize the French WordPress community, based on her experience at large events over the past few years. She replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Had you asked me that last year I might have responded &#8220;fractured and stubborn&#8221;, but that is clearly no longer the case. I really feel that something special happened at WordCamp Europe back in October, something that inspired a momentum that we&#8217;re all still riding on today. People are coming together, opening up and crossing divides. There is a ton of creative energy and talent here — what&#8217;s been missing is the true spirit of giving and sharing, of community! That is shifting and it&#8217;s exciting to be a part of it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s good news to hear that WordPress events in Europe are bringing the French WordPress community together in a new way, with more meetups and collaboration on the horizon.

Another advantage is that unlike online services, you&#8217;re not limited to a maximum number of URLs that can be checked.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/XenuCheckURL.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14902]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14961" alt="Xenu Check URL" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/XenuCheckURL-500x452.jpg" width="500" height="452" /></a></p>\n<p>When I generated a report for WPTavern.com, Xenu used between 29-30 threads and checked over 10,000 urls. Green colored text signals no errors while red indicates a problem. In my case, it usually meant the image was not found. Since a report can be made up of thousands of links, Xenu Link Sleuth provides the ability to only view broken ones.</p>\n<div id="attachment_14962" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/XenuStatusText.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14902]"><img class="size-large wp-image-14962" alt="Xenu Link Sleuth Status Text" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/XenuStatusText-500x250.jpg" width="500" height="250" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Green Is Good.

Integrity was recently updated to include support for Mavericks and retina displays.</p>\n<h3>Good Practice or Waste Of Time?</h3>\n<p>By using Xenu Link Sleuth, I was able to see hundreds of broken links of the thousands that make up the WPTavern archive. I feel conflicted on whether I should fix them or not. Links breaking are part of the natural life cycle of the web. Part of me wants to make sure each link that exists on the domain works correctly. The other part feels that by changing the URL, I would be altering history. Should I only concern myself with links up to a certain time period? How often do you check for broken links on your site? What programs or services do you use to perform the task?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 18:00:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: GoDaddy Launches Managed WordPress Hosting Service";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=14897";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:164:"http://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-service?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=godaddy-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-service";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5948:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoDaddyLogoSmall.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[14897]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14958" alt="GoDaddy Small Logo" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoDaddyLogoSmall.jpg" width="169" height="77" /></a>As Marcus Couch <a title="http://wptavern.com/its-go-time-godaddy-teases-future-managed-wordpress-hosting" href="http://wptavern.com/its-go-time-godaddy-teases-future-managed-wordpress-hosting">hinted at</a> back on November 27th, 2013, GoDaddy has <a title="http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx?ci=86979" href="http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx?ci=86979">entered the Managed WordPress hosting</a> space.

Here is a comparison between a few different WordPress managed hosting providers using their cheapest plan as the lowest common denominator.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GoDaddy &#8211; <strong>$6.99</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Siteground &#8211; <strong>$9.95</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Flywheel &#8211; <strong>$15.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>DreamPress &#8211; <strong>$19.95</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Pagely &#8211; <strong>$24.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Pressable &#8211; <strong>$25.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Synthesis &#8211; <strong>$27.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>WP Engine &#8211; <strong>$29.00</strong> / month</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>GoDaddy Is The Cheapest But That Doesn&#8217;t Mean They Win</h3>\n<p>If price were the only determining factor for choosing a managed WordPress webhost, GoDaddy would win. However, it&#8217;s important to note that each company applies different limits and options to their plans. These variations are one of the reasons for the variety of prices. Based on conversations I&#8217;ve had with a number of WordPress consultants who deal with webhosting companies on a daily basis, GoDaddy is not on the top of their list as a recommendation to their clients.</p>\n<p><a title="http://wptavern.com/its-go-time-godaddy-teases-future-managed-wordpress-hosting#comment-49430" href="http://wptavern.com/its-go-time-godaddy-teases-future-managed-wordpress-hosting#comment-49430">According to Donnacha</a>, GoDaddy entering the market should help push prices closer to where they ought to be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Frankly, the existing “specialist” WordPress hosting companies are useless when a client has anything more than a minor problem. I have long thought that what customers are getting is, roughly, a $10 value for $30, with ridiculous jumps in billing for minor increases in resources. The entry of bigger players such as GoDaddy will, at least, push prices closer to where they should be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With that said, I don&#8217;t think established managed WordPress hosting companies have anything to fear. GoDaddy may have the cheapest prices, but they will have to work extremely hard to earn back the goodwill of the WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>Low Prices Won&#8217;t Be Enough</h3>\n<p>Since the departure of Bob Parsons as CEO, the company has changed its image from sexy women and hunting elephants to being much more professional as a business. I think GoDaddy has improved in many areas in the past two years but they still have a ways to go. The company has sponsored a number of WordCamps and has been very supportive of the WordPress project. But it&#8217;s going to take time and dedication to change the minds of so many WordPress hosting customers who have had a bad experience with the company the past three years. I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I hear people recommending GoDaddy for hosting versus the other way around.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from customers who are currently using the new GoDaddy managed WordPress hosting service.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 17:30:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: 10 Free Plugins to Customize WordPress Admin Color Schemes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=14676";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:180:"http://wptavern.com/10-free-plugins-to-customize-wordpress-admin-color-schemes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-free-plugins-to-customize-wordpress-admin-color-schemes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7061:"<p>Can you believe that there are already ten plugins available for customizing WordPress admin color schemes? This feature has been popular among plugin developers since the new admin design was added in the 3.8 release. We&#8217;ve selected ten plugins that offer a wide variety of ways to customize and control admin color schemes. Many of these plugins have very similar names, so it might be easy to get them confused. However, if you look closely you&#8217;ll find each does something slightly different.</p>\n<h3>Admin Color Schemes</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemes/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/admin-color-schemes.png" alt="admin-color-schemes" width="1544" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14917" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress ships with eight different color schemes. The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemes/" target="_blank">Admin Color Schemes</a> plugin adds eight additional, professionally designed options for you to choose from. </p>\n<h3>Grey Admin Color Schemes</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/grey-admin-color-schemes/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/grey.png" alt="grey" width="772" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14922" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/grey-admin-color-schemes/" target="_blank">Grey Admin Color Schemes</a> plugin offers four slightly varied grey schemes, including the classic grey color scheme from WordPress 3.7, a blue-tinted grey scheme, a modern grey and a post-modern grey.</p>\n<h3>Admin Color Schemer</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemer/"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/featured-admin-color-schemer.jpg" alt="featured-admin-color-schemer" width="800" height="259" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13824" /></a></p>\n<p>We <a href="http://wptavern.com/admin-color-schemer-the-easiest-way-to-customize-wordpress-admin-colors" target="_blank">featured</a> the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemer/" target="_blank">Admin Color Schemer</a> plugin on WPTavern at the end of December.

Jonathan VanSchaack, director of the web division of <a href="http://www.remcom.net/" target="_blank">Remly Communications</a>, offered to fill us in on some of the details behind what happened to NodeKi&#8217;s customers before the collapse of the company. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had the opportunity to purchase NodeKi clients that were actively paying.  We did express some interest in the Lifetime clients but we chose not to as any business plan that relies on 0 revenue long term is due to fail. That being said we sent our own letter out to the paying customers of NodeKi letting them know we will be migrating them to our servers in the long term but also keeping their servers active.  We felt we could provide superior services along with great support to those clients. </p></blockquote>\n<p>VanSchaack said that he purchased the customers directly from NodeKi and not the InterQuad holding company. As <a href="http://www.remcom.net/" target="_blank">Remly</a> has been in business for 11 years and offers managed hosting for WordPress and other CMS platforms, they felt that it was a great fit. &#8220;Remly purchased the clients for expansion,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;We are in a growth area of our business now that we feel infrastructure is at a very stable point.&#8221; </p>\n<p>When asked how he became aware that NodeKi was wanting to sell off all of its customers, VanSchaack said that he was informed of the sale opportunity by a broker:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The current owner was looking for a home for the customers that would give similar support and offerings. To be honest his asking price was far below market value. As in my opinion, he was trying to find the right place for the customers he could move.  We looked at the lifetime clients but did not feel they fit into our business plan.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>An Offer For Displaced Lifetime Customers</h3>\n<p>Remly Hosting is offering a three month free trial matching the top lifetime plan NodeKi offered for those customer who have been displaced. This includes migration services for cPanel to cPanel transfers. VanSchaack has already been in contact with the owner and says that he is willing to give access to client accounts where permission is given by the customer. The plan includes a comparable set of resources previously provided by NodeKi, in terms of disk space, bandwidth, databases, additional domains. </p>\n<p>After the three months, former NodeKi customers can elect to break away from the hosting or transition to one of Remly&#8217;s paid Managed WordPress plans starting at $12.95 a month. VanSchaack said, &#8220;<strong>Our goal is to help customers that might be having issues on such a short notice but also show them our services are the same if not better than NodeKi and to stick with us long term.</strong>&#8221; Any NodeKi customers who are interested can email <a href="mailto:sales@remly.com">sales@remly.com</a> or open a support ticket under the NodeKi account and Remly will get involved. </p>\n<p>The lesson to consumers here is that no lifetime plan is ever guaranteed to last a lifetime, and may not even be available for the lifetime of the company. Customers can be bought and sold at any time. When you&#8217;re looking for a WordPress host, it&#8217;s good to do a little background research into the stability of the company, especially if it is new and offering deals that might seem too good to be true.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 22:23:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: New WordPress Trac Features Have Been Ported to bbPress and BuddyPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=14720";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:204:"http://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-trac-features-have-been-ported-to-bbpress-and-buddypress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-wordpress-trac-features-have-been-ported-to-bbpress-and-buddypress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3078:"<p>So far, 2014 is the year for making over <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress Trac</a>. Over the past couple weeks and during the holidays, Andrew Nacin has implemented a host of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements" target="_blank">new features</a> that make it easier for contributors to collaborate with one another, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-adds-per-ticket-notifications-to-trac" target="_blank">get better ticket notifications</a> and work more efficiently with new reports and keywords for sorting tickets.</p>\n<p>Yesterday Nacin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2014/01/15/trac-updates/" target="_blank">posted</a> that he has now ported over most of these new features to other tracs hosted on WordPress.org (meta, bbPress, BuddyPress, GlotPress, themes and plugins), including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use WP.org cookie authentication, SSL and refreshed design</li>\n<li>bbPress and BuddyPress now have their own skins</li>\n<li>Image attachment previews in tickets</li>\n<li>Email address syncing</li>\n<li>IRC cross-references for #wordpress-meta, #buddypress-dev, #bbpress-dev, #glotpress, #wordpress-gsoc</li>\n<li>Lots of bug fixes and tweaks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember those pale yellow colored tickets? Trac is looking much better with projects using their own skins:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/buddypress-trac.png" rel="prettyphoto[14720]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/buddypress-trac.png" alt="buddypress-trac" width="1500" height="926" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14863" /></a></p>\n<p>As BuddyPress, bbPress and other large projects use trac in a similar way to WordPress, it only makes sense that the new features would be ported over. It be awesome to have the same ticket-starring and per-ticket notifications features that have been added to the WordPress trac. Nacin said that these features are on their way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Notifications are coming very soon to BuddyPress, bbPress, GlotPress, and meta. Probably in the next few days. Once a Trac is running the new notifications feature, that means it has been migrated to MySQL, which means the data is more accessible to the rest of WP.org, as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nacin has also been experimenting with design/functionality of the plugins trac, which is looking pretty snazzy already:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/plugin-trac.png" rel="prettyphoto[14720]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/plugin-trac.png" alt="plugin-trac" width="1571" height="1309" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14872" /></a></p>\n<p>He&#8217;s still working to add links from the plugin directory to these new pages, which could make things interesting for plugin authors. He also plans to add per-plugin notifications where committers will be subscribed by default. If you&#8217;re a plugin developer, watch for these changes to be added to WordPress.org in the coming days.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 06:34:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"Matt: WordPress &amp; Techmeme 100";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43451";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"http://ma.tt/2014/01/techmeme-100/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2134:"<p>Whenever I visit a site I can usually tell whether it&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> or not within an instant &#8212; there&#8217;s just something about a WordPress site that is distinctive. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Super-clean permalinks</a> are usually a dead giveaway.

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-2', '', '', '2013-06-14 09:54:12', '2013-06-14 09:54:12', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In one moment, students are laughing hysterically, moving actively on their feet, and shouting “ROCK ON!” at the top of their lungs. Yet only minutes later, that same room is silent; students find themselves hanging on to every word of Scott’s heartfelt and challenging message.

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-3', '', '', '2013-06-17 11:32:15', '2013-06-17 11:32:15', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear.

Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job.

This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-7', '', '', '2013-06-17 11:29:19', '2013-06-17 11:29:19', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In one moment, students are laughing hysterically, moving actively on their feet, and shouting “ROCK ON!” at the top of their lungs. Yet only minutes later, that same room is silent; students find themselves hanging on to every word of Scott’s heartfelt and challenging message. It is at this point that the students in attendance realize they are no longer watching a presentation to an audience of hundreds or even thousands—they are hearing their own personal call to action.\r\n\r\n“Scott is different because he doesn’t demand anything. He simply asks students what they should be demanding from themselves and from each other… getting them to aspire to a higher calling, a higher purpose.  Scott’s speech laid the groundwork for our entire leadership program.”\r\n- Craig Sutphin, Director of Student Leadership, St. Mary’s HS, Berkeley, CA\r\n\r\nScott gets that students have a HUGE impact on those around them—from their casual acquaintances at school to the close friends they see virtually 24/7. Each and every student has the power to influence their world in some way, shape, or form. Before changing anything, though, each student must undoubtedly recognize that the world in which they live is not perfect by any means.

An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference.

In one moment, students are laughing hysterically, moving actively on their feet, and shouting “ROCK ON!” at the top of their lungs. Yet only minutes later, that same room is silent; students find themselves hanging on to every word of Scott’s heartfelt and challenging message. It is at this point that the students in attendance realize they are no longer watching a presentation to an audience of hundreds or even thousands—they are hearing their own personal call to action.\r\n\r\n“Scott is different because he doesn’t demand anything. He simply asks students what they should be demanding from themselves and from each other… getting them to aspire to a higher calling, a higher purpose.  Scott’s speech laid the groundwork for our entire leadership program.”\r\n- Craig Sutphin, Director of Student Leadership, St. Mary’s HS, Berkeley, CA\r\n\r\nScott gets that students have a HUGE impact on those around them—from their casual acquaintances at school to the close friends they see virtually 24/7. Each and every student has the power to influence their world in some way, shape, or form. Before changing anything, though, each student must undoubtedly recognize that the world in which they live is not perfect by any means. It takes passion and determination to make it a better place.\r\nRegardless of the situation, capacity, or context, the only way students will truly change their circumstances is if they decide to be a catalyst—someone who changes the status quo.\r\n\r\nPast Speech Topics / Workshops Include\r\nRespect\r\nSchool Spirit\r\nIssue Awareness\r\nStandardized Testing\r\nFreshman Orientation\r\nSenior Institute Days\r\nBullying\r\nPublic Speaking\r\nStudent Activity Planning\r\nand many more…\r\n\r\n', 'Scott Backovich', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '119-revision-12', '', '', '2013-06-21 12:40:59', '2013-06-21 12:40:59', '', 119, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/119-revision-12/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-7', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:22:47', '2013-06-21 14:22:47', '', 159, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/159-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear.

Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-11', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:31:49', '2013-06-21 14:31:49', '', 150, 'http://biziindia.com/finaospeakers/150-revision-11/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear. Student athletes are making the newspaper with increasing regularity, but unfortunately they are appearing in the wrong section of the paper. Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-14', '', '', '2013-06-22 08:30:27', '2013-06-22 08:30:27', '', 150, 'http://finaospeakers.com/150-revision-14/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In one moment, students are laughing hysterically, moving actively on their feet, and shouting “ROCK ON!” at the top of their lungs. Yet only minutes later, that same room is silent; students find themselves hanging on to every word of Scott’s heartfelt and challenging message. It is at this point that the students in attendance realize they are no longer watching a presentation to an audience of hundreds or even thousands—they are hearing their own personal call to action.\r\n\r\n“Scott is different because he doesn’t demand anything. He simply asks students what they should be demanding from themselves and from each other… getting them to aspire to a higher calling, a higher purpose.  Scott’s speech laid the groundwork for our entire leadership program.”\r\n- Craig Sutphin, Director of Student Leadership, St. Mary’s HS, Berkeley, CA\r\n\r\nScott gets that students have a HUGE impact on those around them—from their casual acquaintances at school to the close friends they see virtually 24/7. Each and every student has the power to influence their world in some way, shape, or form. Before changing anything, though, each student must undoubtedly recognize that the world in which they live is not perfect by any means. It takes passion and determination to make it a better place.\r\nRegardless of the situation, capacity, or context, the only way students will truly change their circumstances is if they decide to be a catalyst—someone who changes the status quo.\r\n\r\nPast Speech Topics / Workshops Include\r\nRespect\r\nSchool Spirit\r\nIssue Awareness\r\nStandardized Testing\r\nFreshman Orientation\r\nSenior Institute Days\r\nBullying\r\nPublic Speaking\r\nStudent Activity Planning\r\nand many more…\r\n\r\n', 'Scott Backovich', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '119-revision-16', '', '', '2013-06-21 14:42:08', '2013-06-21 14:42:08', '', 119, 'http://finaospeakers.com/119-revision-16/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Using his personal stories and those from students across the country, Aaron challenges students to THINK about the impact of their choices. He constantly reminds them that a choice takes only seconds to make, but the consequences can last a lifetime or even take your life or the lives of others.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be reminded of the power of their choices.\r\n\r\nLeadership is SIMPLE, but it’s Not Always EASY!\r\nThis presentation shares with young leaders the key factors of being an AWESOME leader!\r\nIt seems like every day there is a new form of leadership being talked about. It’s no wonder today’s young people are so confused on what makes a good leader. This presentation gives them simple yet timeless truths on the characteristics of being an effective leader. Aaron also warns that although the principles to becoming a great leader may be simple, carrying them out can be difficult.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to self-evaluate their own leadership styles in search of ways to improve.\r\n•	Students will learn the importance of relationships and how they can impact them directly and indirectly.\r\n•	Students will be reminded to fiercely protect their integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Being a Student Athlete (How to avoid embarrassing your school, family & yourself)\r\nThis presentation is one that every student athlete must hear. Student athletes are making the newspaper with increasing regularity, but unfortunately they are appearing in the wrong section of the paper. Instead of the sports pages, they are frequently being mentioned in the area that lists arrests and court appearances. Aaron shares with students the realities of being a student athlete and how the “rules” are different for them compared to other students, and how by failing to abide by the rules almost assures embarrassment and blown opportunities.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Student athletes will be equipped with decision-making strategies to help them avoid making bad choices.\r\n•	Student athletes will be encouraged to steer clear of places/people where negative situations could quickly arise.\r\n•	Student athletes will be reminded that participating in sports is a privilege and should never be taken lightly or for granted.\r\nDon’t Go and Look for a Job. Search for Your Passion!\r\nThis session is one that encourages students to passionately pursue the careers they love!\r\nThe average adult will have close to a dozen different jobs with various companies in their working lifetime. One cause for this is that they simply have a “job” instead of being engaged in a career that they are passionate about. This presentation challenges students to pursue and research what their passions truly are.\r\nPresentation Outcomes:\r\n•	Students will be encouraged to constantly remain curious and research the areas they are passionate about.\r\n•	Students will be given strategies to develop skills that make them appealing to potential employers.\r\n•	Students will be reminded that the choices they make today will affect their future.\r\n', 'Aaron Davis ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-15', '', '', '2013-06-28 04:36:09', '2013-06-28 04:36:09', '', 150, 'http://finaospeakers.com/150-revision-15/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The crazy that sits in silence and hears a song that has never been written, the kind that stares at an empty canvas and sees a work of art or gazes at a red planet and see’s a laboratory on wheels. \r\nJohan believes that we all have a little bit of crazy in us that is waiting to be unleashed. His story is CRAZY, to say the least. He is a product of Humboldt Park Chicago, one of the roughest areas in Chicago; an area where he has witnessed everything from friends being killed to family members living destructive lives. An area of Chicago, he was told, he would never get out of. An area where, he was told, he would never make it, never amount to anything, never succeed, never create, never inspire. \r\nJohan refused to believe the messages of his environment. Instead, he was crazy enough to believe his life could make a difference. He was crazy enough to make choices that no one else was making; he decided to live a life worth living as a teen and young adult. \r\nNow he is spending his life encouraging kids to be crazy enough to think that their lives can make a difference. While others use their voice to be “realistic”, Johan motivates kids to move past reality and begin to dream and create even the craziest of possibilities for their lives and the world around them.\r\nTopics Covered in The Crazy Ones Include… \r\n• The Power of Healthy Choices\r\n• The Importance of Goals and Dreams\r\n• Critical Thinking\r\n• Striving for Excellence\r\n• Believing in yourself\r\n• The Significance of Good Role Models\r\n• Becoming an Agent of Change\r\n• Withstanding Peer Pressure\r\n• \r\n“Strength and Honor: Manhood and the Masculine Journey”\r\nAudience: Teens or Young Adults\r\nLength 45-60 Minutes\r\n\r\n“I’m a real man!”\r\nThose words spill out of the mouths of males of every shape, size, age, and color. But what do those words really mean? Have we really figured out the mystery of masculinity? Do we know what a real man looks and acts like? Or have we bought into our culture’s perception of manhood and masculinity? \r\nIn this informative and thought-provoking session, Johan leads us through some of the primary misconceptions of manhood and then unveils the primal essence of a “man”… \r\nBecause being a “man” and a male aren’t one in the same.\r\nTopics covered in “Strength and Honor” Include… \r\n• The Top Misconceptions of Manhood\r\n• The Result of false “Manhood”\r\n• Masculinity defined\r\n• The True Essence of a Man\r\n', 'Johan Khalilian ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '159-revision-10', '', '', '2013-06-22 05:54:13', '2013-06-22 05:54:13', '', 159, 'http://finaospeakers.com/159-revision-10/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

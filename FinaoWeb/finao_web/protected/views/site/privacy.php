            <p><strong>We use the latest technologies to ensure that your email address and all personal information is safe.</strong></p>
            <p>JoMoWaG, LLC - Dba FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup>and/or its subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this website, strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, email address, street address and telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
             <p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>   
             <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. </p>
             <p>Like most Web sites, JoMoWaG, LLC - Dba FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup>, and/or its subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this website, also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.</p>
             <p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
             <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>

            <p class="about-text text-align-left font-20px">FINAO&reg; (fin-nay-o) began as a movement in the early 1990s based on the belief that Failure Is Not An Option. Today, it continues this belief by introducing a new type of social media platform &#45; Social Marker &#45; a safe and open place where you get down to the core of who you are and not just what you are doing. The platform is a disruptive, game-changing digital offering that provides its users with a unique and engaging unification of technology, branded products and speaker-based curriculum.</p>
            <p class="about-text  text-align-left font-20px">Our team is a mix of career-minded individuals who decided it's time to put family first, taking the risk to leave secure career positions to follow their dreams, and who wake up saying, "I will leave a positive mark on this world." This passion is evident in everything we do, but most importantly, it manifests itself in our efforts to ensure our members have great experiences in expressing their FINAOs.</p>

            <p class="about-text text-align-left font-20px"><strong>Wallace Greene &#45; Founder and CEO </strong></p>
            <p class="about-text text-align-left font-20px">Wallace is a former Microsoftie.  He was there for 15 years, where among other things, he was the OEM Operations leader - yeah, we're not sure what that means either. He led the build out of 126 businesses into 26 countries (read: lots of frequent flier miles.)  Many of these companies were start-ups, where Wallace had to wear many hats - from setting up international supply chains to managing budgets; we're talking in the millions, people.</p>
            <p class="about-text  text-align-left font-20px">One of Wallace's professional FINAOs was to grow a world-class operations model and supply chain to support the growth of a $4 billion business to a $10 billion+ business (yes, with a "b"). Mission accomplished. As a humble award-winner and rouge entrepreneur, Wallace sees opportunities in everyday life, loves strategy and is passionate about building solid foundations that can support the weight of creativity. </p>
            <p class="about-text  text-align-left font-20px">Wallace's FINAO: 'I will create a people-oriented business operations model that will delight, and make a difference in people's lives.'</p>

            <p class="about-text  text-align-left font-20px">Scott started off as an independent business owner who partnered with the largest youth recognition company in the U.S. &#45; Jostens. That&#8217;s right &#45; the company that sells rings and things. Scott has also been the Assistant National Director at DeVry University (those commercials!) where he managed their national recruitment sales team. Additionally, he has successfully built his own sales-based business (growing sales from $300,000 to $2 million in a year) and has been a business development consultant for other sales start-ups, transforming them into thriving, cash-flow positive businesses. NIKE, Inc., the world&#8217;s leading designer and distributor of athletic footwear and apparel, was one of Scott&#8217;s strategic relationships where his businesses helped to strengthen the iconic brand.</p>
            <p class="about-text  text-align-left font-20px">Scott loves the energy of today's high school students and he has introduced motivational and leadership training courses in dozens of high schools. At least twice a week, Scott is speaking in front of 200+ students at schools throughout the state of Washington, and loves every minute of it. </p>
            <p class="about-text  text-align-left font-20px">Scott&#8217;s FINAO: <i>"I will impact lives and change futures by helping to create a culture of encouragement and goodness."</i></p>

Prior to the purchase of any goods or services on our Site, you must provide us with a valid credit card number and associated payment information including all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) your credit card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.

               <p>All payments must be made by VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover Card. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Terms of Use to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup>, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. Unless you notify FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> or its agents. You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your purchases and shipping, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes. FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> shall automatically charge and withhold the applicable sales tax for orders to be delivered to addresses within Washington State and any other states or localities that it deems are required.</p>

               <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Customers issuing chargeback(s) with their Credit Card's issuing Bank without proper cause will be billed any fees incurred by FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> in disputing the chargeback as well as a $25.00 Chargeback fee. This is necessary to recover the charges we were billed by Visa/MasterCard/Discover Card when the no cause chargeback was issued. With this type of fraud/negligence on the rise, and little recourse given to the Merchant by the credit card issuers, we must protect ourselves from this new type of crime/negligence.</p>

FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> upon our shipment of products or delivery of services that you have ordered. All orders placed over $1000.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department.

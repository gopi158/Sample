<p class="blue-font15">What is Parent Valet?</p>
  <p class="run-text font-12px">Parent Valet is an online community that helps parents make better education decisions. Everything we do is geared toward helping children succeed, and providing parents with access to information crucial to that success. With our online tools, parents can find and compare schools, stay more informed, and search out programs and services based on interests, budget, location and preferences. We help break down the barriers that keep children from getting the education, enrichment and support they deserve. </p>

<p class="blue-font15">What’s Behind Our Name?</p>
  <p class="run-text font-12px">Parent Valet. Those are two words you don’t normally see together, right?</p>
  <p class="run-text font-12px">“Parent” can refer to a mother, father, grandparent or guardian. In the spirit of “It takes a village to raise a child,” it can be anyone who takes responsibility for nurturing and cultivating a child’s curiosity, talents, and interests. </p>
  <p class="run-text font-12px">“Valet” is another word for attendant. Helper. Someone devoted to service. </p> 
  <p class="run-text font-12px">So it stands to reason “Parent Valet” is devoted to helping parents, and that’s exactly what we do—we help them save time, avoid frustration, and provide much-needed information.</p> 
  

<p class="blue-font15">Meet the Team</p>

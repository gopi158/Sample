SkiDuck's first year was quite a success story. From its conception in August '09 by Executive Director Clint Lunde it was a less than six months before SkiDUCK had it's first outing at Squaw Valley on February 7, 2010. More than 30 students from Reno's North Valleys middle and high schools skied and snowboarded for their first time ever! Middle-schooler Corey Lundy summed up the day - "I felt like Superman, I was on top of the world!"</div>

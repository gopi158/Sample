        	<div class="content-run-text">FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> began as a movement in the early 1990s based on the belief that Failure Is Not An Option. It is now an online community where you can safely declare your goals in your private personal profile. FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> empowers you to form goals that align with your personal passions and capabilities. We call these statements of commitment "FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup>s" (fin-nāy-o), which stands for "Failure Is Not An Option."</div>
        	<div class="content-run-text">Everyone's different, so the FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> is completely customizable to help you create the goal-oriented life you want to live. Set your goals. Track your progress. Share what you want with others. Follow others to become inspired. </div>
        	<div class="orange font-20px padding-10pixels">The FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup> Team</div>
        	<div class="content-run-text">Our team is a mix of career-minded individuals who decided it's time to put family first, taking the risk to leave secure career positions to follow dreams, and who wake up saying, "I will leave a positive mark on this world."  </div>
			<div class="content-run-text">We're laser-focused on the personal pursuit of aspirations, commitments, values, and goals; all distinct individuals defining success on our own terms. Despite our unique personal values and definitions of success we are driven by one principle – Failure Is Not An Option.</div>
			<div class="content-run-text">That passion is evident in everything we do, but most importantly it manifests itself in our efforts to ensure our members have a great experience while expressing their own FINAO<sup>&reg;</sup>.</div>

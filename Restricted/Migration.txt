Copy the build from GIT, place the same in the root / in a folder of the local webserver (like xampp or wamp).
Copy yii framework and point this folder in the index.php file.

Add the databases and the cdn urls in the finao.local.php (under /protected/config).
If you added the files in the folder finao, the local url will be your cdn url here. Example: http://localhost/finao. 
Make sure you have the assets and runtime folders with write permissions.
In the server we need to have the curl and rewrite mod enabled.
The database doesn’t need any special instructions as you can directly import into phpmyadmin.
